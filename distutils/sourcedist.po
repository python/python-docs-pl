msgid ""
"Sometimes this is enough, but usually you will want to specify additional "
"files to distribute.  The typical way to do this is to write a *manifest "
"template*, called :file:`MANIFEST.in` by default.  The manifest template is "
"just a list of instructions for how to generate your manifest file, :file:"
"`MANIFEST`, which is the exact list of files to include in your source "
"distribution.  The :command:`sdist` command processes this template and "
"generates a manifest based on its instructions and what it finds in the "
"filesystem."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you prefer to roll your own manifest file, the format is simple: one "
"filename per line, regular files (or symlinks to them) only.  If you do "
"supply your own :file:`MANIFEST`, you must specify everything: the default "
"set of files described above does not apply in this case."

"An existing generated :file:`MANIFEST` will be regenerated without :command:"

":file:`MANIFEST` files start with a comment indicating they are generated. "
"Files without this comment are not overwritten or removed."

msgid ""
":command:`sdist` will read a :file:`MANIFEST` file if no :file:`MANIFEST.in` "
"exists, like it used to do."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":file:`README.rst` is now included in the list of distutils standard READMEs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The manifest template has one command per line, where each command specifies "
"a set of files to include or exclude from the source distribution.  For an "
"example, again we turn to the Distutils' own manifest template:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The meanings should be fairly clear: include all files in the distribution "
"root matching :file:`\\*.txt`, all files anywhere under the :file:`examples` "
"directory matching :file:`\\*.txt` or :file:`\\*.py`, and exclude all "
"directories matching :file:`examples/sample?/build`.  All of this is done "
"*after* the standard include set, so you can exclude files from the standard "
"set with explicit instructions in the manifest template.  (Or, you can use "
"the :option:`!--no-defaults` option to disable the standard set entirely.)  "
"There are several other commands available in the manifest template mini-"
"language; see section :ref:`sdist-cmd`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The order of commands in the manifest template matters: initially, we have "
"the list of default files as described above, and each command in the "
"template adds to or removes from that list of files.  Once we have fully "
"processed the manifest template, we remove files that should not be included "
"in the source distribution:"
