"Python on a Mac running macOS is in principle very similar to Python on any "
"other Unix platform, but there are a number of additional features such as "
"the integrated development environment (IDE) and the Package Manager that "
"are worth pointing out."
msgstr ""

msgid "Getting and Installing Python"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"macOS used to come with Python 2.7 pre-installed between versions 10.8 and "
"`12.3 <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/"
"macos-12_3-release-notes#Python>`_. You are invited to install the most "
"recent version of Python 3 from the `Python website <https://www.python.org/"
"downloads/macos/>`__. A current \"universal2 binary\" build of Python, which "
"runs natively on the Mac's new Apple Silicon and legacy Intel processors, is "
"available there."
msgstr ""

msgid "What you get after installing is a number of things:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A |python_version_literal| folder in your :file:`Applications` folder. In "
"here you find IDLE, the development environment that is a standard part of "
"official Python distributions; and :program:`Python Launcher`, which handles "
"double-clicking Python scripts from the Finder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A framework :file:`/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework`, which includes the "
"Python executable and libraries. The installer adds this location to your "
"shell path. To uninstall Python, you can remove these three things. A "
"symlink to the Python executable is placed in :file:`/usr/local/bin/`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On macOS 10.8-12.3, the Apple-provided build of Python is installed in :file:"
"`/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework` and :file:`/usr/bin/python`, "
"respectively. You should never modify or delete these, as they are Apple-"
"controlled and are used by Apple- or third-party software.  Remember that if "
"you choose to install a newer Python version from python.org, you will have "
"two different but functional Python installations on your computer, so it "
"will be important that your paths and usages are consistent with what you "
"want to do."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"IDLE includes a Help menu that allows you to access Python documentation. If "
"you are completely new to Python you should start reading the tutorial "
"introduction in that document."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are familiar with Python on other Unix platforms you should read the "
"section on running Python scripts from the Unix shell."
msgstr ""

msgid "How to run a Python script"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your best way to get started with Python on macOS is through the IDLE "
"integrated development environment; see section :ref:`ide` and use the Help "
"menu when the IDE is running."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to run Python scripts from the Terminal window command line or "
"from the Finder you first need an editor to create your script. macOS comes "
"with a number of standard Unix command line editors, :program:`vim` :program:"
"`nano` among them. If you want a more Mac-like editor, :program:`BBEdit` "
"from Bare Bones Software (see https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/"
"index.html) are good choices, as is :program:`TextMate` (see https://"
"macromates.com). Other editors include :program:`MacVim` (https://macvim."
"org) and :program:`Aquamacs` (https://aquamacs.org)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To run your script from the Terminal window you must make sure that :file:`/"
"usr/local/bin` is in your shell search path."
msgstr ""

msgid "To run your script from the Finder you have two options:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Drag it to :program:`Python Launcher`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select :program:`Python Launcher` as the default application to open your "
"script (or any ``.py`` script) through the finder Info window and double-"
"click it. :program:`Python Launcher` has various preferences to control how "
"your script is launched. Option-dragging allows you to change these for one "
"invocation, or use its Preferences menu to change things globally."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running scripts with a GUI"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With older versions of Python, there is one macOS quirk that you need to be "
"aware of: programs that talk to the Aqua window manager (in other words, "
"anything that has a GUI) need to be run in a special way. Use :program:"
"`pythonw` instead of :program:`python` to start such scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With Python 3.9, you can use either :program:`python` or :program:`pythonw`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python on macOS honors all standard Unix environment variables such as :"
"envvar:`PYTHONPATH`, but setting these variables for programs started from "
"the Finder is non-standard as the Finder does not read your :file:`.profile` "
"or :file:`.cshrc` at startup. You need to create a file :file:`~/.MacOSX/"
"environment.plist`. See Apple's `Technical Q&A QA1067 <https://developer."
"apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1067/_index.html>`__ for details."

"The standard Python GUI toolkit is :mod:`tkinter`, based on the cross-"
