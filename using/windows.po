msgid "Using Python on Windows"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This document aims to give an overview of Windows-specific behaviour you "
"should know about when using Python on Microsoft Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike most Unix systems and services, Windows does not include a system "
"supported installation of Python. To make Python available, the CPython team "
"has compiled Windows installers (MSI packages) with every `release <https://"
"www.python.org/download/releases/>`_ for many years. These installers are "
"primarily intended to add a per-user installation of Python, with the core "
"interpreter and library being used by a single user. The installer is also "
"able to install for all users of a single machine, and a separate ZIP file "
"is available for application-local distributions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As specified in :pep:`11`, a Python release only supports a Windows platform "
"while Microsoft considers the platform under extended support. This means "
"that Python |version| supports Windows 8.1 and newer. If you require Windows "
"7 support, please install Python 3.8."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are a number of different installers available for Windows, each with "
"certain benefits and downsides."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`windows-full` contains all components and is the best option for "
"developers using Python for any kind of project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`windows-store` is a simple installation of Python that is suitable for "
"running scripts and packages, and using IDLE or other development "
"environments. It requires Windows 10 and above, but can be safely installed "
"without corrupting other programs. It also provides many convenient commands "
"for launching Python and its tools."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`windows-nuget` are lightweight installations intended for continuous "
"integration systems. It can be used to build Python packages or run scripts, "
"but is not updateable and has no user interface tools."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`windows-embeddable` is a minimal package of Python suitable for "
"embedding into a larger application."
msgstr ""

msgid "The full installer"
msgstr ""

msgid "Installation steps"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Four Python |version| installers are available for download - two each for "
"the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the interpreter. The *web installer* is a "
"small initial download, and it will automatically download the required "
"components as necessary. The *offline installer* includes the components "
"necessary for a default installation and only requires an internet "
"connection for optional features. See :ref:`install-layout-option` for other "
"ways to avoid downloading during installation."
msgstr ""

msgid "After starting the installer, one of two options may be selected:"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you select \"Install Now\":"

msgid "Removing the MAX_PATH Limitation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Windows historically has limited path lengths to 260 characters. This meant "
"that paths longer than this would not resolve and errors would result."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the latest versions of Windows, this limitation can be expanded to "
"approximately 32,000 characters. Your administrator will need to activate "
"the \"Enable Win32 long paths\" group policy, or set ``LongPathsEnabled`` to "
"``1`` in the registry key "
"``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\FileSystem``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This allows the :func:`open` function, the :mod:`os` module and most other "
"path functionality to accept and return paths longer than 260 characters."
msgstr ""

msgid "After changing the above option, no further configuration is required."
msgstr ""

msgid "Installing Without UI"
msgstr "Instalacja bez graficznego interfejsu użytkownika"

msgid ""
"All of the options available in the installer UI can also be specified from "

msgstr ""

msgid "Installing Without Downloading"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As some features of Python are not included in the initial installer "
"download, selecting those features may require an internet connection.  To "
"avoid this need, all possible components may be downloaded on-demand to "
"create a complete *layout* that will no longer require an internet "
"connection regardless of the selected features. Note that this download may "
"be bigger than required, but where a large number of installations are going "
"to be performed it is very useful to have a locally cached copy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Execute the following command from Command Prompt to download all possible "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"Repair\" will verify all the files that should be installed using the "

msgid "The Microsoft Store package"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Microsoft Store package is an easily installable Python interpreter that "
"is intended mainly for interactive use, for example, by students."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To install the package, ensure you have the latest Windows 10 updates and "

"Python will always be available for free on the Microsoft Store. If you are "
"asked to pay for it, you have not selected the correct package."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After installation, Python may be launched by finding it in Start. "

msgid ""
"Virtual environments can be created with ``python -m venv`` and activated "
"and used as normal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have installed another version of Python and added it to your "
"``PATH`` variable, it will be available as ``python.exe`` rather than the "
"one from the Microsoft Store. To access the new installation, use ``python3."
"exe`` or ``python3.x.exe``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``py.exe`` launcher will detect this Python installation, but will "
"prefer installations from the traditional installer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To remove Python, open Settings and use Apps and Features, or else find "
"Python in Start and right-click to select Uninstall. Uninstalling will "
"remove all packages you installed directly into this Python installation, "
"but will not remove any virtual environments"
msgstr ""

msgid "Known issues"
msgstr ""

msgid "Redirection of local data, registry, and temporary paths"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because of restrictions on Microsoft Store apps, Python scripts may not have "
"full write access to shared locations such as :envvar:`TEMP` and the "
"registry. Instead, it will write to a private copy. If your scripts must "
"modify the shared locations, you will need to install the full installer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At runtime, Python will use a private copy of well-known Windows folders and "
"the registry. For example, if the environment variable :envvar:`%APPDATA%` "
"is :file:`c:\\\\Users\\\\<user>\\\\AppData\\\\`, then when writing to :file:"
"`C:\\\\Users\\\\<user>\\\\AppData\\\\Local` will write to :file:`C:\\"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When reading files, Windows will return the file from the private folder, or "
"if that does not exist, the real Windows directory. For example reading :"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The nuget.org package is a reduced size Python environment intended for use "

"package, and without the ``-ExcludeVersion`` option this name will include "
"the specific version installed. Inside the subdirectory is a ``tools`` "
"directory that contains the Python installation:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, nuget packages are not upgradeable, and newer versions should be "
"installed side-by-side and referenced using the full path. Alternatively, "
"delete the package directory manually and install it again. Many CI systems "
"will do this automatically if they do not preserve files between builds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alongside the ``tools`` directory is a ``build\\native`` directory. This "

msgid "The embeddable package"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The embedded distribution is a ZIP file containing a minimal Python "
"environment. It is intended for acting as part of another application, "
"rather than being directly accessed by end-users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When extracted, the embedded distribution is (almost) fully isolated from "
"the user's system, including environment variables, system registry "
"settings, and installed packages. The standard library is included as pre-"
"compiled and optimized ``.pyc`` files in a ZIP, and ``python3.dll``, "
"``python37.dll``, ``python.exe`` and ``pythonw.exe`` are all provided. Tcl/"
"tk (including all dependents, such as Idle), pip and the Python "
"documentation are not included."

"application installer to provide this. The runtime may have already been "
"installed on a user's system previously or automatically via Windows Update, "
"and can be detected by finding ``ucrtbase.dll`` in the system directory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Third-party packages should be installed by the application installer "
"alongside the embedded distribution. Using pip to manage dependencies as for "
"a regular Python installation is not supported with this distribution, "
"though with some care it may be possible to include and use pip for "
"automatic updates. In general, third-party packages should be treated as "
"part of the application (\"vendoring\") so that the developer can ensure "
"compatibility with newer versions before providing updates to users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The two recommended use cases for this distribution are described below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Python Application"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An application written in Python does not necessarily require users to be "
"aware of that fact. The embedded distribution may be used in this case to "
"include a private version of Python in an install package. Depending on how "
"transparent it should be (or conversely, how professional it should appear), "
"there are two options."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using a specialized executable as a launcher requires some coding, but "
"provides the most transparent experience for users. With a customized "
"launcher, there are no obvious indications that the program is running on "
"Python: icons can be customized, company and version information can be "
"specified, and file associations behave properly. In most cases, a custom "
"launcher should simply be able to call ``Py_Main`` with a hard-coded command "
"line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The simpler approach is to provide a batch file or generated shortcut that "
"directly calls the ``python.exe`` or ``pythonw.exe`` with the required "
"command-line arguments. In this case, the application will appear to be "
"Python and not its actual name, and users may have trouble distinguishing it "
"from other running Python processes or file associations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the latter approach, packages should be installed as directories "
"alongside the Python executable to ensure they are available on the path. "
"With the specialized launcher, packages can be located in other locations as "
"there is an opportunity to specify the search path before launching the "
"application."
msgstr ""

msgid "Embedding Python"
msgstr "Załączanie programu interpretującego język pytonowski"

msgid ""
"Applications written in native code often require some form of scripting "
"language, and the embedded Python distribution can be used for this purpose. "
"In general, the majority of the application is in native code, and some part "
"will either invoke ``python.exe`` or directly use ``python3.dll``. For "
"either case, extracting the embedded distribution to a subdirectory of the "
"application installation is sufficient to provide a loadable Python "
"interpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As with the application use, packages can be installed to any location as "
"there is an opportunity to specify search paths before initializing the "
"interpreter. Otherwise, there is no fundamental differences between using "
"the embedded distribution and a regular installation."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``/usr/bin/env`` form of shebang line has one further special property. "
"Before looking for installed Python interpreters, this form will search the "
"executable :envvar:`PATH` for a Python executable matching the name provided "
"as the first argument. This corresponds to the behaviour of the Unix ``env`` "
"program, which performs a :envvar:`PATH` search. If an executable matching "
"the first argument after the ``env`` command cannot be found, but the "
"argument starts with ``python``, it will be handled as described for the "
"other virtual commands. The environment variable :envvar:"
"`PYLAUNCHER_NO_SEARCH_PATH` may be set (to any value) to skip this search "

"your system. The name of the command must be a single argument (no spaces in "

"executable (additional arguments specified in the .INI will be quoted as "
"part of the filename)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any commands not found in the .INI file are treated as **Windows** "
"executable paths that are absolute or relative to the directory containing "

msgid "Customizing default Python versions"

"In some cases, a version qualifier can be included in a command to dictate "

"specify if a 32 or 64 bit implementation shall be requested by adding "
"\"-32\" or \"-64\"."

"If no minor version qualifiers are found, the environment variable "
"``PY_PYTHON{major}`` (where ``{major}`` is the current major version "

msgid ""
"On 64-bit Windows with both 32-bit and 64-bit implementations of the same "
"(major.minor) Python version installed, the 64-bit version will always be "
"preferred. This will be true for both 32-bit and 64-bit implementations of "
"the launcher - a 32-bit launcher will prefer to execute a 64-bit Python "
"installation of the specified version if available. This is so the behavior "
"of the launcher can be predicted knowing only what versions are installed on "
"the PC and without regard to the order in which they were installed (i.e., "
"without knowing whether a 32 or 64-bit version of Python and corresponding "
"launcher was installed last). As noted above, an optional \"-32\" or \"-64\" "
"suffix can be used on a version specifier to change this behaviour."

"The command ``python3.7`` will not consult any options at all as the "
