"Python on iOS is unlike Python on desktop platforms. On a desktop platform, "
"Python is generally installed as a system resource that can be used by any "
"user of that computer. Users then interact with Python by running a :program:"
"`python` executable and entering commands at an interactive prompt, or by "
"running a Python script."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On iOS, there is no concept of installing as a system resource. The only "
"unit of software distribution is an \"app\". There is also no console where "
"you could run a :program:`python` executable, or interact with a Python REPL."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a result, the only way you can use Python on iOS is in embedded mode - "
"that is, by writing a native iOS application, and embedding a Python "
"interpreter using ``libPython``, and invoking Python code using the :ref:"
"`Python embedding API <embedding>`. The full Python interpreter, the "
"standard library, and all your Python code is then packaged as a standalone "
"bundle that can be distributed via the iOS App Store."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're looking to experiment for the first time with writing an iOS app "
"in Python, projects such as `BeeWare <https://beeware.org>`__ and `Kivy "
"<https://kivy.org>`__ will provide a much more approachable user experience. "
"These projects manage the complexities associated with getting an iOS "
"project running, so you only need to deal with the Python code itself."

"The minimum supported iOS version is specified at compile time, using the :"
"option:`--host` option to ``configure``. By default, when compiled for iOS, "
"Python will be compiled with a minimum supported iOS version of 13.0. To use "
"a different minimum iOS version, provide the version number as part of the :"
"option:`!--host` argument - for example, ``--host=arm64-apple-ios15.4-"
"simulator`` would compile an ARM64 simulator build with a deployment target "
"of 15.4."

msgid "Platform identification"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When executing on iOS, ``sys.platform`` will report as ``ios``. This value "
"will be returned on an iPhone or iPad, regardless of whether the app is "
"running on the simulator or a physical device."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Information about the specific runtime environment, including the iOS "
"version, device model, and whether the device is a simulator, can be "
"obtained using :func:`platform.ios_ver()`. :func:`platform.system()` will "
"report ``iOS`` or ``iPadOS``, depending on the device."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`os.uname()` reports kernel-level details; it will report a name of "

msgid "Standard library availability"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Python standard library has some notable omissions and restrictions on "
"iOS. See the :ref:`API availability guide for iOS <iOS-availability>` for "
"details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Binary extension modules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One notable difference about iOS as a platform is that App Store "
"distribution imposes hard requirements on the packaging of an application. "
"One of these requirements governs how binary extension modules are "
"distributed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The iOS App Store requires that *all* binary modules in an iOS app must be "
"dynamic libraries, contained in a framework with appropriate metadata, "
"stored in the ``Frameworks`` folder of the packaged app. There can be only a "
"single binary per framework, and there can be no executable binary material "
"outside the ``Frameworks`` folder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This conflicts with the usual Python approach for distributing binaries, "
"which allows a binary extension module to be loaded from any location on "
"``sys.path``. To ensure compliance with App Store policies, an iOS project "
"must post-process any Python packages, converting ``.so`` binary modules "
"into individual standalone frameworks with appropriate metadata and signing. "
"For details on how to perform this post-processing, see the guide for :ref:"
"`adding Python to your project <adding-ios>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To help Python discover binaries in their new location, the original ``.so`` "
"file on ``sys.path`` is replaced with a ``.fwork`` file. This file is a text "
"file containing the location of the framework binary, relative to the app "
"bundle. To allow the framework to resolve back to the original location, the "
"framework must contain a ``.origin`` file that contains the location of the "
"``.fwork`` file, relative to the app bundle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, consider the case of an import ``from foo.bar import _whiz``, "
"where ``_whiz`` is implemented with the binary module ``sources/foo/bar/"
"_whiz.abi3.so``, with ``sources`` being the location registered on ``sys."
"path``, relative to the application bundle. This module *must* be "
"distributed as ``Frameworks/foo.bar._whiz.framework/foo.bar._whiz`` "
"(creating the framework name from the full import path of the module), with "
"an ``Info.plist`` file in the ``.framework`` directory identifying the "
"binary as a framework. The ``foo.bar._whiz`` module would be represented in "
"the original location with a ``sources/foo/bar/_whiz.abi3.fwork`` marker "
"file, containing the path ``Frameworks/foo.bar._whiz/foo.bar._whiz``. The "
"framework would also contain ``Frameworks/foo.bar._whiz.framework/foo.bar."
"_whiz.origin``, containing the path to the ``.fwork`` file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When running on iOS, the Python interpreter will install an :class:"
"`~importlib.machinery.AppleFrameworkLoader` that is able to read and import "
"``.fwork`` files. Once imported, the ``__file__`` attribute of the binary "
"module will report as the location of the ``.fwork`` file. However, the :"
"class:`~importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec` for the loaded module will report "
"the ``origin`` as the location of the binary in the framework folder."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compiler stub binaries"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Xcode doesn't expose explicit compilers for iOS; instead, it uses an "
"``xcrun`` script that resolves to a full compiler path (e.g., ``xcrun --sdk "
"iphoneos clang`` to get the ``clang`` for an iPhone device). However, using "
"this script poses two problems:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The output of ``xcrun`` includes paths that are machine specific, resulting "
"in a sysconfig module that cannot be shared between users; and"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It results in ``CC``/``CPP``/``LD``/``AR`` definitions that include spaces. "
"There is a lot of C ecosystem tooling that assumes that you can split a "
"command line at the first space to get the path to the compiler executable; "
"this isn't the case when using ``xcrun``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To avoid these problems, Python provided stubs for these tools. These stubs "
"are shell script wrappers around the underingly ``xcrun`` tools, distributed "
"in a ``bin`` folder distributed alongside the compiled iOS framework. These "
"scripts are relocatable, and will always resolve to the appropriate local "
"system paths. By including these scripts in the bin folder that accompanies "
"a framework, the contents of the ``sysconfig`` module becomes useful for end-"
"users to compile their own modules. When compiling third-party Python "
"modules for iOS, you should ensure these stub binaries are on your path."

msgid "Tools for building iOS apps"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Building for iOS requires the use of Apple's Xcode tooling. It is strongly "
"recommended that you use the most recent stable release of Xcode. This will "
"require the use of the most (or second-most) recently released macOS "
"version, as Apple does not maintain Xcode for older macOS versions. The "
"Xcode Command Line Tools are not sufficient for iOS development; you need a "
"*full* Xcode install."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to run your code on the iOS simulator, you'll also need to "
"install an iOS Simulator Platform. You should be prompted to select an iOS "
"Simulator Platform when you first run Xcode. Alternatively, you can add an "
"iOS Simulator Platform by selecting from the Platforms tab of the Xcode "
"Settings panel."

msgid "Adding Python to an iOS project"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python can be added to any iOS project, using either Swift or Objective C. "
"The following examples will use Objective C; if you are using Swift, you may "

"be helpful."

msgid ""
"Build or obtain a Python ``XCFramework``. See the instructions in :source:"
"`iOS/README.rst` (in the CPython source distribution) for details on how to "
