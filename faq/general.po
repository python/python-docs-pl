msgid "What is Python?"
msgstr "Czym jest Python?"

msgid ""
"Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming "
"language.  It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high "
"level dynamic data types, and classes.  It supports multiple programming "
"paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and "
"functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear "
"syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to "
"various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++.  It is also usable as "
"an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. "
"Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux "
"and macOS, and on Windows."

msgid "Why was Python created in the first place?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here's a *very* brief summary of what started it all, written by Guido van "
"Rossum:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I had extensive experience with implementing an interpreted language in the "
"ABC group at CWI, and from working with this group I had learned a lot about "
"language design.  This is the origin of many Python features, including the "
"use of indentation for statement grouping and the inclusion of very-high-"
"level data types (although the details are all different in Python)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I had a number of gripes about the ABC language, but also liked many of its "
"features.  It was impossible to extend the ABC language (or its "
"implementation) to remedy my complaints -- in fact its lack of extensibility "
"was one of its biggest problems.  I had some experience with using Modula-2+ "
"and talked with the designers of Modula-3 and read the Modula-3 report. "
"Modula-3 is the origin of the syntax and semantics used for exceptions, and "
"some other Python features."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I was working in the Amoeba distributed operating system group at CWI.  We "
"needed a better way to do system administration than by writing either C "
"programs or Bourne shell scripts, since Amoeba had its own system call "
"interface which wasn't easily accessible from the Bourne shell.  My "
"experience with error handling in Amoeba made me acutely aware of the "
"importance of exceptions as a programming language feature."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It occurred to me that a scripting language with a syntax like ABC but with "
"access to the Amoeba system calls would fill the need.  I realized that it "
"would be foolish to write an Amoeba-specific language, so I decided that I "
"needed a language that was generally extensible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During the 1989 Christmas holidays, I had a lot of time on my hand, so I "
"decided to give it a try.  During the next year, while still mostly working "
"on it in my own time, Python was used in the Amoeba project with increasing "
"success, and the feedback from colleagues made me add many early "
"improvements."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In February 1991, after just over a year of development, I decided to post "
"to USENET.  The rest is in the ``Misc/HISTORY`` file."
msgstr ""

msgid "What is Python good for?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can be "
"applied to many different classes of problems."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The language comes with a large standard library that covers areas such as "
"string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating differences "
"between files), internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, XML-RPC, POP, IMAP), "
"software engineering (unit testing, logging, profiling, parsing Python "
"code), and operating system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, TCP/IP "
"sockets).  Look at the table of contents for :ref:`library-index` to get an "
"idea of what's available.  A wide variety of third-party extensions are also "
"available.  Consult `the Python Package Index <https://pypi.org>`_ to find "
"packages of interest to you."
msgstr ""

msgid "How does the Python version numbering scheme work?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Python versions are numbered \"A.B.C\" or \"A.B\":"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*A* is the major version number -- it is only incremented for really major "
"changes in the language."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*B* is the minor version number -- it is incremented for less earth-"
"shattering changes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*C* is the micro version number -- it is incremented for each bugfix release."
msgstr ""

msgid "See :pep:`6` for more information about bugfix releases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Not all releases are bugfix releases.  In the run-up to a new minor release, "
"a series of development releases are made, denoted as alpha, beta, or "
"release candidate.  Alphas are early releases in which interfaces aren't yet "
"finalized; it's not unexpected to see an interface change between two alpha "
"releases. Betas are more stable, preserving existing interfaces but possibly "
"adding new modules, and release candidates are frozen, making no changes "
"except as needed to fix critical bugs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alpha, beta and release candidate versions have an additional suffix:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The suffix for an alpha version is \"aN\" for some small number *N*."
msgstr ""

msgid "The suffix for a beta version is \"bN\" for some small number *N*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The suffix for a release candidate version is \"rcN\" for some small number "
"*N*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In other words, all versions labeled *2.0aN* precede the versions labeled "
"*2.0bN*, which precede versions labeled *2.0rcN*, and *those* precede 2.0."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may also find version numbers with a \"+\" suffix, e.g. \"2.2+\".  These "
"are unreleased versions, built directly from the CPython development "
"repository.  In practice, after a final minor release is made, the version "
"is incremented to the next minor version, which becomes the \"a0\" version, "
"e.g. \"2.4a0\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See also the documentation for :data:`sys.version`, :data:`sys.hexversion`, "
"and :data:`sys.version_info`."

msgid "How do I obtain a copy of the Python source?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The latest Python source distribution is always available from python.org, "
"at https://www.python.org/downloads/.  The latest development sources can be "
"obtained at https://github.com/python/cpython/."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The source distribution is a gzipped tar file containing the complete C "
"source, Sphinx-formatted documentation, Python library modules, example "
"programs, and several useful pieces of freely distributable software.  The "
"source will compile and run out of the box on most UNIX platforms."

msgid "Is there a newsgroup or mailing list devoted to Python?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is a newsgroup, :newsgroup:`comp.lang.python`, and a mailing list, "
"`python-list <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-list>`_.  The "
"newsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed into each other -- if you can read "
"news it's unnecessary to subscribe to the mailing list. :newsgroup:`comp."
"lang.python` is high-traffic, receiving hundreds of postings every day, and "
"Usenet readers are often more able to cope with this volume."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Announcements of new software releases and events can be found in comp.lang."
"python.announce, a low-traffic moderated list that receives about five "

msgid "Are there any books on Python?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Yes, there are many, and more are being published.  See the python.org wiki "
"at https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBooks for a list."

msgid ""
"The Python project's infrastructure is located all over the world and is "
"managed by the Python Infrastructure Team. Details `here <https://infra.psf."

msgstr ""

msgid "Why is it called Python?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the "
"published scripts from `\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" <https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python>`__, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s.  "
"Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly "
"mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python."

msgstr ""

msgid "No, but it helps.  :)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Python in the real world"
msgstr ""

msgid "How stable is Python?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Very stable.  New, stable releases have been coming out roughly every 6 to "
"18 months since 1991, and this seems likely to continue.  As of version 3.9, "
"Python will have a minor new release every 12 months (:pep:`602`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The developers issue \"bugfix\" releases of older versions, so the stability "
"of existing releases gradually improves.  Bugfix releases, indicated by a "
"third component of the version number (e.g. 3.5.3, 3.6.2), are managed for "
"stability; only fixes for known problems are included in a bugfix release, "
"and it's guaranteed that interfaces will remain the same throughout a series "
"of bugfix releases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The latest stable releases can always be found on the `Python download page "
"<https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.  There are two production-ready "
"versions of Python: 2.x and 3.x. The recommended version is 3.x, which is "
"supported by most widely used libraries.  Although 2.x is still widely used, "
"`it is not maintained anymore <https://peps.python.org/pep-0373/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "How many people are using Python?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are probably millions of users, though it's difficult to obtain an "
"exact count."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python is available for free download, so there are no sales figures, and "
"it's available from many different sites and packaged with many Linux "
"distributions, so download statistics don't tell the whole story either."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The comp.lang.python newsgroup is very active, but not all Python users post "
"to the group or even read it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Have any significant projects been done in Python?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See https://www.python.org/about/success for a list of projects that use "
"Python. Consulting the proceedings for `past Python conferences <https://www."
"python.org/community/workshops/>`_ will reveal contributions from many "
"different companies and organizations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"High-profile Python projects include `the Mailman mailing list manager "
"<https://www.list.org>`_ and `the Zope application server <https://www.zope."
"dev>`_.  Several Linux distributions, most notably `Red Hat <https://www."
"redhat.com>`_, have written part or all of their installer and system "
"administration software in Python.  Companies that use Python internally "
"include Google, Yahoo, and Lucasfilm Ltd."
msgstr ""

msgid "What new developments are expected for Python in the future?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See https://peps.python.org/ for the Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs). "
"PEPs are design documents describing a suggested new feature for Python, "
"providing a concise technical specification and a rationale.  Look for a PEP "
"titled \"Python X.Y Release Schedule\", where X.Y is a version that hasn't "
"been publicly released yet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"New development is discussed on `the python-dev mailing list <https://mail."
"python.org/mailman3/lists/python-dev.python.org/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is it reasonable to propose incompatible changes to Python?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, no.  There are already millions of lines of Python code around "
"the world, so any change in the language that invalidates more than a very "
"small fraction of existing programs has to be frowned upon.  Even if you can "
"provide a conversion program, there's still the problem of updating all "
"documentation; many books have been written about Python, and we don't want "
"to invalidate them all at a single stroke."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Providing a gradual upgrade path is necessary if a feature has to be "
"changed. :pep:`5` describes the procedure followed for introducing backward-"
"incompatible changes while minimizing disruption for users."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is Python a good language for beginning programmers?"
msgstr ""

msgid "Yes."
msgstr "Tak"

msgid ""
"It is still common to start students with a procedural and statically typed "
"language such as Pascal, C, or a subset of C++ or Java.  Students may be "
"better served by learning Python as their first language.  Python has a very "
"simple and consistent syntax and a large standard library and, most "
"importantly, using Python in a beginning programming course lets students "
"concentrate on important programming skills such as problem decomposition "
"and data type design.  With Python, students can be quickly introduced to "
"basic concepts such as loops and procedures.  They can probably even work "
"with user-defined objects in their very first course."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a student who has never programmed before, using a statically typed "
"language seems unnatural.  It presents additional complexity that the "
"student must master and slows the pace of the course.  The students are "
"trying to learn to think like a computer, decompose problems, design "
"consistent interfaces, and encapsulate data.  While learning to use a "
"statically typed language is important in the long term, it is not "
"necessarily the best topic to address in the students' first programming "
"course."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many other aspects of Python make it a good first language.  Like Java, "
"Python has a large standard library so that students can be assigned "
"programming projects very early in the course that *do* something.  "
"Assignments aren't restricted to the standard four-function calculator and "
"check balancing programs.  By using the standard library, students can gain "
"the satisfaction of working on realistic applications as they learn the "
"fundamentals of programming. Using the standard library also teaches "
"students about code reuse.  Third-party modules such as PyGame are also "
"helpful in extending the students' reach."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python's interactive interpreter enables students to test language features "
"while they're programming.  They can keep a window with the interpreter "
"running while they enter their program's source in another window.  If they "
"can't remember the methods for a list, they can do something like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the interpreter, documentation is never far from the student as they "
"are programming."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are also good IDEs for Python.  IDLE is a cross-platform IDE for "
"Python that is written in Python using Tkinter. Emacs users will be happy to "
"know that there is a very good Python mode for Emacs.  All of these "
"programming environments provide syntax highlighting, auto-indenting, and "
"access to the interactive interpreter while coding.  Consult `the Python "
"wiki <https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors>`_ for a full list of "
"Python editing environments."
