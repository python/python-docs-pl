msgid "How do I run a Python program under Windows?"
msgstr "Jak uruchomić program napisany w Pythonie w systemie Windows?"

msgid ""
"This is not necessarily a straightforward question. If you are already "
"familiar with running programs from the Windows command line then everything "
"will seem obvious; otherwise, you might need a little more guidance."
msgstr ""
"Na to pytanie nie ma łatwej odpowiedzi. Jeśli jesteś zaznajomiony z "
"programami uruchamianymi z wiersza poleceń systemu Windows, wtedy jest to "
"banalne.  W innym przypadku musisz skorzystać, ze wskazówek."

msgid ""
"Unless you use some sort of integrated development environment, you will end "
"up *typing* Windows commands into what is referred to as a \"Command prompt "
"window\".  Usually you can create such a window from your search bar by "
"searching for ``cmd``.  You should be able to recognize when you have "
"started such a window because you will see a Windows \"command prompt\", "
"which usually looks like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The letter may be different, and there might be other things after it, so "
"you might just as easily see something like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"depending on how your computer has been set up and what else you have "
"recently done with it.  Once you have started such a window, you are well on "
"the way to running Python programs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You need to realize that your Python scripts have to be processed by another "
"program called the Python *interpreter*.  The interpreter reads your script, "
"compiles it into bytecodes, and then executes the bytecodes to run your "
"program. So, how do you arrange for the interpreter to handle your Python?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, you need to make sure that your command window recognises the word "
"\"py\" as an instruction to start the interpreter.  If you have opened a "
"command window, you should try entering the command ``py`` and hitting "
"return:"
msgstr ""
"Po pierwsze upewnij się, że wiersz poleceń odpowiada na komendę \"py\" jest "
"to instrukcja uruchamiająca interpreter. Jeśli masz uruchomione okno wiersza "
"poleceń, spróbuj wpisać komendę ``py`` i wciśnij enter."

msgid "You should then see something like:"
msgstr "Powinieneś zauważyć coś w stylu:"

msgid ""
"You have started the interpreter in \"interactive mode\". That means you can "
"enter Python statements or expressions interactively and have them executed "
"or evaluated while you wait.  This is one of Python's strongest features.  "
"Check it by entering a few expressions of your choice and seeing the results:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many people use the interactive mode as a convenient yet highly programmable "
"calculator.  When you want to end your interactive Python session, call the :"
"func:`exit` function or hold the :kbd:`Ctrl` key down while you enter a :kbd:"
"`Z`, then hit the \":kbd:`Enter`\" key to get back to your Windows command "
"prompt."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may also find that you have a Start-menu entry such as :menuselection:"
"`Start --> Programs --> Python 3.x --> Python (command line)` that results "
"in you seeing the ``>>>`` prompt in a new window.  If so, the window will "
"disappear after you call the :func:`exit` function or enter the :kbd:`Ctrl-"
"Z` character; Windows is running a single \"python\" command in the window, "
"and closes it when you terminate the interpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now that we know the ``py`` command is recognized, you can give your Python "
"script to it. You'll have to give either an absolute or a relative path to "
"the Python script. Let's say your Python script is located in your desktop "
"and is named ``hello.py``, and your command prompt is nicely opened in your "
"home directory so you're seeing something similar to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So now you'll ask the ``py`` command to give your script to Python by typing "
"``py`` followed by your script path::"
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I make Python scripts executable?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, the standard Python installer already associates the .py "
"extension with a file type (Python.File) and gives that file type an open "
"command that runs the interpreter (``D:\\Program Files\\Python\\python.exe "
"\"%1\" %*``).  This is enough to make scripts executable from the command "
"prompt as 'foo.py'.  If you'd rather be able to execute the script by simple "
"typing 'foo' with no extension you need to add .py to the PATHEXT "
"environment variable."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why does Python sometimes take so long to start?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Usually Python starts very quickly on Windows, but occasionally there are "
"bug reports that Python suddenly begins to take a long time to start up.  "
"This is made even more puzzling because Python will work fine on other "
"Windows systems which appear to be configured identically."
msgstr ""
"Zazwyczaj Python startuje w Windowsie bardzo szybko, czasem jednak wysłanie "
"raportów o błędach może spowolnić jego uruchomienie. Taki moment może być "
"frustrujący, ponieważ Python zainstalowany na innym komputerze wydaje się "
"działać dobrze, pomimo identycznej konfiguracji."

msgid ""
"The problem may be caused by a misconfiguration of virus checking software "
"on the problem machine.  Some virus scanners have been known to introduce "
"startup overhead of two orders of magnitude when the scanner is configured "
"to monitor all reads from the filesystem.  Try checking the configuration of "
"virus scanning software on your systems to ensure that they are indeed "
"configured identically. McAfee, when configured to scan all file system read "
"activity, is a particular offender."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I make an executable from a Python script?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See :ref:`faq-create-standalone-binary` for a list of tools that can be used "
"to make executables."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is a ``*.pyd`` file the same as a DLL?"
msgstr "Czy plik typu ``*.pyd`` jest tym samym co DLL?"

msgid ""
"Yes, .pyd files are dll's, but there are a few differences.  If you have a "
"DLL named ``foo.pyd``, then it must have a function ``PyInit_foo()``.  You "
"can then write Python \"import foo\", and Python will search for foo.pyd (as "
"well as foo.py, foo.pyc) and if it finds it, will attempt to call "
"``PyInit_foo()`` to initialize it.  You do not link your .exe with foo.lib, "
"as that would cause Windows to require the DLL to be present."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the search path for foo.pyd is PYTHONPATH, not the same as the "
"path that Windows uses to search for foo.dll.  Also, foo.pyd need not be "
"present to run your program, whereas if you linked your program with a dll, "
"the dll is required.  Of course, foo.pyd is required if you want to say "
"``import foo``.  In a DLL, linkage is declared in the source code with "
"``__declspec(dllexport)``. In a .pyd, linkage is defined in a list of "
"available functions."
msgstr ""

msgid "How can I embed Python into a Windows application?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Embedding the Python interpreter in a Windows app can be summarized as "
"follows:"
msgstr ""
"Wbudowany interpreter Python w windowsowej aplikacji może być podsumowany "
"następująco:"

msgid ""
"Do **not** build Python into your .exe file directly.  On Windows, Python "
"must be a DLL to handle importing modules that are themselves DLL's.  (This "
"is the first key undocumented fact.)  Instead, link to :file:`python{NN}."
"dll`; it is typically installed in ``C:\\Windows\\System``.  *NN* is the "
"Python version, a number such as \"33\" for Python 3.3."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can link to Python in two different ways.  Load-time linking means "
"linking against :file:`python{NN}.lib`, while run-time linking means linking "
"against :file:`python{NN}.dll`.  (General note: :file:`python{NN}.lib` is "
"the so-called \"import lib\" corresponding to :file:`python{NN}.dll`.  It "
"merely defines symbols for the linker.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Run-time linking greatly simplifies link options; everything happens at run "
"time.  Your code must load :file:`python{NN}.dll` using the Windows "
"``LoadLibraryEx()`` routine.  The code must also use access routines and "
"data in :file:`python{NN}.dll` (that is, Python's C API's) using pointers "
"obtained by the Windows ``GetProcAddress()`` routine.  Macros can make using "
"these pointers transparent to any C code that calls routines in Python's C "
"API."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you use SWIG, it is easy to create a Python \"extension module\" that "
"will make the app's data and methods available to Python.  SWIG will handle "
"just about all the grungy details for you.  The result is C code that you "
"link *into* your .exe file (!)  You do **not** have to create a DLL file, "
"and this also simplifies linking."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"SWIG will create an init function (a C function) whose name depends on the "
"name of the extension module.  For example, if the name of the module is "
"leo, the init function will be called initleo().  If you use SWIG shadow "
"classes, as you should, the init function will be called initleoc().  This "
"initializes a mostly hidden helper class used by the shadow class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The reason you can link the C code in step 2 into your .exe file is that "
"calling the initialization function is equivalent to importing the module "
"into Python! (This is the second key undocumented fact.)"
msgstr ""
"Spowodowane jest to faktem, że możesz linkować kod w kroku 2 do twojego "
"pliku .exe. Jest to nazywane funkcją inicjalizacji i jest to ekwiwalent "
"importu modułu Pythona."

msgid ""
"In short, you can use the following code to initialize the Python "
"interpreter with your extension module."
msgstr ""
"W skrócie możesz użyć poniższego kodu do uruchomienia interpretera Python w "
"twoim rozszerzonym module."

msgid ""
"There are two problems with Python's C API which will become apparent if you "
"use a compiler other than MSVC, the compiler used to build pythonNN.dll."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Problem 1: The so-called \"Very High Level\" functions that take ``FILE *`` "
"arguments will not work in a multi-compiler environment because each "
"compiler's notion of a ``struct FILE`` will be different.  From an "
"implementation standpoint these are very low level functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Problem 2: SWIG generates the following code when generating wrappers to "
"void functions:"
msgstr ""
"Problem nr. 2: SWIG generuje następujący kod kiedy generujesz wrapper do "
"funkcji void."

msgid ""
"Alas, Py_None is a macro that expands to a reference to a complex data "
"structure called _Py_NoneStruct inside pythonNN.dll.  Again, this code will "
"fail in a mult-compiler environment.  Replace such code by:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It may be possible to use SWIG's ``%typemap`` command to make the change "
"automatically, though I have not been able to get this to work (I'm a "
"complete SWIG newbie)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using a Python shell script to put up a Python interpreter window from "
"inside your Windows app is not a good idea; the resulting window will be "
"independent of your app's windowing system.  Rather, you (or the "
"wxPythonWindow class) should create a \"native\" interpreter window.  It is "
"easy to connect that window to the Python interpreter.  You can redirect "
"Python's i/o to _any_ object that supports read and write, so all you need "
"is a Python object (defined in your extension module) that contains read() "
"and write() methods."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I keep editors from inserting tabs into my Python source?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The FAQ does not recommend using tabs, and the Python style guide, :pep:`8`, "
"recommends 4 spaces for distributed Python code; this is also the Emacs "
"python-mode default."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Under any editor, mixing tabs and spaces is a bad idea.  MSVC is no "
"different in this respect, and is easily configured to use spaces: Take :"
"menuselection:`Tools --> Options --> Tabs`, and for file type \"Default\" "
"set \"Tab size\" and \"Indent size\" to 4, and select the \"Insert spaces\" "
"radio button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python raises :exc:`IndentationError` or :exc:`TabError` if mixed tabs and "
"spaces are causing problems in leading whitespace. You may also run the :mod:"
"`tabnanny` module to check a directory tree in batch mode."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I check for a keypress without blocking?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the :mod:`msvcrt` module.  This is a standard Windows-specific extension "
"module. It defines a function ``kbhit()`` which checks whether a keyboard "
"hit is present, and ``getch()`` which gets one character without echoing it."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I solve the missing api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll error?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This can occur on Python 3.5 and later when using Windows 8.1 or earlier "
"without all updates having been installed. First ensure your operating "
"system is supported and is up to date, and if that does not resolve the "
"issue, visit the `Microsoft support page <https://support.microsoft.com/en-"
"us/help/3118401/>`_ for guidance on manually installing the C Runtime update."
