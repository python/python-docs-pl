"For third-party packages, search the `Python Package Index <https://pypi."

msgid "Where is the math.py (socket.py, regex.py, etc.) source file?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you can't find a source file for a module it may be a built-in or "

msgid "How do I make a Python script executable on Unix?"
msgstr "Jak mogę zrobić skrypt Pythona wykonywalnym na systemie Unix?"

msgid ""
"You need to do two things: the script file's mode must be executable and the "
"first line must begin with ``#!`` followed by the path of the Python "
"interpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first is done by executing ``chmod +x scriptfile`` or perhaps ``chmod "
"755 scriptfile``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second can be done in a number of ways.  The most straightforward way is "
"to write ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"as the very first line of your file, using the pathname for where the Python "
"interpreter is installed on your platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you would like the script to be independent of where the Python "
"interpreter lives, you can use the :program:`env` program.  Almost all Unix "
"variants support the following, assuming the Python interpreter is in a "
"directory on the user's :envvar:`PATH`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Don't* do this for CGI scripts.  The :envvar:`PATH` variable for CGI "
"scripts is often very minimal, so you need to use the actual absolute "
"pathname of the interpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Occasionally, a user's environment is so full that the :program:`/usr/bin/"
"env` program fails; or there's no env program at all.  In that case, you can "
"try the following hack (due to Alex Rezinsky):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The minor disadvantage is that this defines the script's __doc__ string. "
"However, you can fix that by adding ::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Is there a curses/termcap package for Python?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For Unix variants: The standard Python source distribution comes with a "
"curses module in the :source:`Modules` subdirectory, though it's not "
"compiled by default. (Note that this is not available in the Windows "
"distribution -- there is no curses module for Windows.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`curses` module supports basic curses features as well as many "
"additional functions from ncurses and SYSV curses such as colour, "
"alternative character set support, pads, and mouse support. This means the "
"module isn't compatible with operating systems that only have BSD curses, "
"but there don't seem to be any currently maintained OSes that fall into this "
"category."
msgstr ""

msgid "Is there an equivalent to C's onexit() in Python?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`atexit` module provides a register function that is similar to "
"C's :c:func:`onexit`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why don't my signal handlers work?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The most common problem is that the signal handler is declared with the "
"wrong argument list.  It is called as ::"
msgstr ""

msgid "so it should be declared with two parameters::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Common tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I test a Python program or component?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python comes with two testing frameworks.  The :mod:`doctest` module finds "
"examples in the docstrings for a module and runs them, comparing the output "
"with the expected output given in the docstring."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`unittest` module is a fancier testing framework modelled on Java "
"and Smalltalk testing frameworks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make testing easier, you should use good modular design in your program. "
"Your program should have almost all functionality encapsulated in either "
"functions or class methods -- and this sometimes has the surprising and "
"delightful effect of making the program run faster (because local variable "
"accesses are faster than global accesses).  Furthermore the program should "
"avoid depending on mutating global variables, since this makes testing much "
"more difficult to do."
msgstr ""

msgid "The \"global main logic\" of your program may be as simple as ::"
msgstr ""

msgid "at the bottom of the main module of your program."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once your program is organized as a tractable collection of function and "
"class behaviours, you should write test functions that exercise the "
"behaviours.  A test suite that automates a sequence of tests can be "
"associated with each module. This sounds like a lot of work, but since "
"Python is so terse and flexible it's surprisingly easy.  You can make coding "
"much more pleasant and fun by writing your test functions in parallel with "
"the \"production code\", since this makes it easy to find bugs and even "
"design flaws earlier."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"Support modules\" that are not intended to be the main module of a program "
"may include a self-test of the module. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Even programs that interact with complex external interfaces may be tested "
"when the external interfaces are unavailable by using \"fake\" interfaces "
"implemented in Python."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I create documentation from doc strings?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`pydoc` module can create HTML from the doc strings in your Python "
"source code.  An alternative for creating API documentation purely from "
"docstrings is `epydoc <https://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>`_.  `Sphinx <https://"
"www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ can also include docstring content."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I get a single keypress at a time?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For Unix variants there are several solutions.  It's straightforward to do "
"this using curses, but curses is a fairly large module to learn."
msgstr ""

msgid "Threads"
msgstr "Wątki"

msgid "How do I program using threads?"
msgstr "Jak programować używając wątków?"

msgid ""
"Be sure to use the :mod:`threading` module and not the :mod:`_thread` "
"module. The :mod:`threading` module builds convenient abstractions on top of "
"the low-level primitives provided by the :mod:`_thread` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "None of my threads seem to run: why?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As soon as the main thread exits, all threads are killed.  Your main thread "
"is running too quickly, giving the threads no time to do any work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A simple fix is to add a sleep to the end of the program that's long enough "
"for all the threads to finish::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But now (on many platforms) the threads don't run in parallel, but appear to "
"run sequentially, one at a time!  The reason is that the OS thread scheduler "
"doesn't start a new thread until the previous thread is blocked."
msgstr ""

msgid "A simple fix is to add a tiny sleep to the start of the run function::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead of trying to guess a good delay value for :func:`time.sleep`, it's "
"better to use some kind of semaphore mechanism.  One idea is to use the :mod:"
"`queue` module to create a queue object, let each thread append a token to "
"the queue when it finishes, and let the main thread read as many tokens from "
"the queue as there are threads."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I parcel out work among a bunch of worker threads?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The easiest way is to use the :mod:`concurrent.futures` module, especially "
"the :mod:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Or, if you want fine control over the dispatching algorithm, you can write "
"your own logic manually.  Use the :mod:`queue` module to create a queue "
"containing a list of jobs.  The :class:`~queue.Queue` class maintains a list "
"of objects and has a ``.put(obj)`` method that adds items to the queue and a "
"``.get()`` method to return them.  The class will take care of the locking "
"necessary to ensure that each job is handed out exactly once."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here's a trivial example::"
msgstr ""

msgid "When run, this will produce the following output:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consult the module's documentation for more details; the :class:`~queue."
"Queue` class provides a featureful interface."
msgstr ""

msgid "What kinds of global value mutation are thread-safe?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :term:`global interpreter lock` (GIL) is used internally to ensure that "
"only one thread runs in the Python VM at a time.  In general, Python offers "
"to switch among threads only between bytecode instructions; how frequently "
"it switches can be set via :func:`sys.setswitchinterval`.  Each bytecode "
"instruction and therefore all the C implementation code reached from each "
"instruction is therefore atomic from the point of view of a Python program."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In theory, this means an exact accounting requires an exact understanding of "
"the PVM bytecode implementation.  In practice, it means that operations on "
"shared variables of built-in data types (ints, lists, dicts, etc) that "
"\"look atomic\" really are."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the following operations are all atomic (L, L1, L2 are lists, "
"D, D1, D2 are dicts, x, y are objects, i, j are ints)::"
msgstr ""

msgid "These aren't::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Operations that replace other objects may invoke those other objects' :meth:"
"`__del__` method when their reference count reaches zero, and that can "
"affect things.  This is especially true for the mass updates to dictionaries "
"and lists.  When in doubt, use a mutex!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Can't we get rid of the Global Interpreter Lock?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :term:`global interpreter lock` (GIL) is often seen as a hindrance to "
"Python's deployment on high-end multiprocessor server machines, because a "
"multi-threaded Python program effectively only uses one CPU, due to the "
"insistence that (almost) all Python code can only run while the GIL is held."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Back in the days of Python 1.5, Greg Stein actually implemented a "
"comprehensive patch set (the \"free threading\" patches) that removed the "
"GIL and replaced it with fine-grained locking.  Adam Olsen recently did a "
"similar experiment in his `python-safethread <https://code.google.com/"
"archive/p/python-safethread>`_ project.  Unfortunately, both experiments "
"exhibited a sharp drop in single-thread performance (at least 30% slower), "
"due to the amount of fine-grained locking necessary to compensate for the "
"removal of the GIL."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This doesn't mean that you can't make good use of Python on multi-CPU "
"machines! You just have to be creative with dividing the work up between "
"multiple *processes* rather than multiple *threads*.  The :class:"
"`~concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` class in the new :mod:`concurrent."
"futures` module provides an easy way of doing so; the :mod:`multiprocessing` "
"module provides a lower-level API in case you want more control over "
"dispatching of tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Judicious use of C extensions will also help; if you use a C extension to "
"perform a time-consuming task, the extension can release the GIL while the "
"thread of execution is in the C code and allow other threads to get some "
"work done.  Some standard library modules such as :mod:`zlib` and :mod:"
"`hashlib` already do this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It has been suggested that the GIL should be a per-interpreter-state lock "
"rather than truly global; interpreters then wouldn't be able to share "
"objects. Unfortunately, this isn't likely to happen either.  It would be a "
"tremendous amount of work, because many object implementations currently "
"have global state. For example, small integers and short strings are cached; "
"these caches would have to be moved to the interpreter state.  Other object "
"types have their own free list; these free lists would have to be moved to "
"the interpreter state. And so on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And I doubt that it can even be done in finite time, because the same "
"problem exists for 3rd party extensions.  It is likely that 3rd party "
"extensions are being written at a faster rate than you can convert them to "
"store all their global state in the interpreter state."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And finally, once you have multiple interpreters not sharing any state, what "
"have you gained over running each interpreter in a separate process?"

msgid "How do I delete a file? (And other file questions...)"
msgstr "Jak usunąć plik? (i inne plikowe pytania…)"

msgid ""
"Use ``os.remove(filename)`` or ``os.unlink(filename)``; for documentation, "
"see the :mod:`os` module.  The two functions are identical; :func:`~os."
"unlink` is simply the name of the Unix system call for this function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To remove a directory, use :func:`os.rmdir`; use :func:`os.mkdir` to create "
"one. ``os.makedirs(path)`` will create any intermediate directories in "
"``path`` that don't exist. ``os.removedirs(path)`` will remove intermediate "
"directories as long as they're empty; if you want to delete an entire "
"directory tree and its contents, use :func:`shutil.rmtree`."
msgstr ""

msgid "To rename a file, use ``os.rename(old_path, new_path)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To truncate a file, open it using ``f = open(filename, \"rb+\")``, and use "
"``f.truncate(offset)``; offset defaults to the current seek position.  "
"There's also ``os.ftruncate(fd, offset)`` for files opened with :func:`os."
"open`, where *fd* is the file descriptor (a small integer)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`shutil` module also contains a number of functions to work on "
"files including :func:`~shutil.copyfile`, :func:`~shutil.copytree`, and :"
"func:`~shutil.rmtree`."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I copy a file?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`shutil` module contains a :func:`~shutil.copyfile` function. Note "
"that on Windows NTFS volumes, it does not copy `alternate data streams "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS#Alternate_data_stream_(ADS)>`_ nor "
"`resource forks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_fork>`__ on macOS "
"HFS+ volumes, though both are now rarely used. It also doesn't copy file "
"permissions and metadata, though using :func:`shutil.copy2` instead will "
"preserve most (though not all) of it."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I read (or write) binary data?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To read or write complex binary data formats, it's best to use the :mod:"
"`struct` module.  It allows you to take a string containing binary data "
"(usually numbers) and convert it to Python objects; and vice versa."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the following code reads two 2-byte integers and one 4-byte "
"integer in big-endian format from a file::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The '>' in the format string forces big-endian data; the letter 'h' reads "
"one \"short integer\" (2 bytes), and 'l' reads one \"long integer\" (4 "
"bytes) from the string."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For data that is more regular (e.g. a homogeneous list of ints or floats), "
"you can also use the :mod:`array` module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To read and write binary data, it is mandatory to open the file in binary "
"mode (here, passing ``\"rb\"`` to :func:`open`).  If you use ``\"r\"`` "
"instead (the default), the file will be open in text mode and ``f.read()`` "
"will return :class:`str` objects rather than :class:`bytes` objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "I can't seem to use os.read() on a pipe created with os.popen(); why?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`os.read` is a low-level function which takes a file descriptor, a "
"small integer representing the opened file.  :func:`os.popen` creates a high-"
"level file object, the same type returned by the built-in :func:`open` "
"function. Thus, to read *n* bytes from a pipe *p* created with :func:`os."
"popen`, you need to use ``p.read(n)``."

msgstr ""

msgid "Why doesn't closing sys.stdout (stdin, stderr) really close it?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python :term:`file objects <file object>` are a high-level layer of "
"abstraction on low-level C file descriptors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For most file objects you create in Python via the built-in :func:`open` "
"function, ``f.close()`` marks the Python file object as being closed from "
"Python's point of view, and also arranges to close the underlying C file "
"descriptor.  This also happens automatically in ``f``'s destructor, when "
"``f`` becomes garbage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But stdin, stdout and stderr are treated specially by Python, because of the "
"special status also given to them by C.  Running ``sys.stdout.close()`` "
"marks the Python-level file object as being closed, but does *not* close the "
"associated C file descriptor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To close the underlying C file descriptor for one of these three, you should "
"first be sure that's what you really want to do (e.g., you may confuse "
"extension modules trying to do I/O).  If it is, use :func:`os.close`::"
