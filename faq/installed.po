"Python is a programming language.  It's used for many different "
"applications. It's used in some high schools and colleges as an introductory "
"programming language because Python is easy to learn, but it's also used by "
"professional software developers at places such as Google, NASA, and "
"Lucasfilm Ltd."

"might have installed it."

"A third-party application installed on the machine might have been written "
"in Python and included a Python installation.  There are many such "
"applications, from GUI programs to network servers and administrative "
"scripts."

"Some Windows machines also have Python installed.  At this writing we're "

"If Python was installed by a third-party application, you can also remove "
"it, but that application will no longer work.  You should use that "
"application's uninstaller rather than removing Python directly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If Python came with your operating system, removing it is not recommended.  "
"If you remove it, whatever tools were written in Python will no longer run, "
"and some of them might be important to you.  Reinstalling the whole system "
"would then be required to fix things again."
