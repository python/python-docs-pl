"Standard builds of Python include an object-oriented interface to the Tcl/Tk "
"widget set, called :ref:`tkinter <Tkinter>`.  This is probably the easiest "
"to install (since it comes included with most `binary distributions <https://"
"www.python.org/downloads/>`_ of Python) and use. For more info about Tk, "
"including pointers to the source, see the `Tcl/Tk home page <https://www.tcl."
"tk>`_.  Tcl/Tk is fully portable to the macOS, Windows, and Unix platforms."
msgstr ""
"Standardowe kompilacje Pythona zawierają obiektowy interfejs do zestawu "
"widżetów Tcl/Tk, zwany :ref:`tkinter <Tkinter>`.  Jest to prawdopodobnie "
"najłatwiejszy do zainstalowania (ponieważ jest dołączony do większości "
"`binarnych dystrybucji <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ Pythona) i "
"używania. Więcej informacji o Tk, w tym wskazówki do źródeł, można znaleźć "
"na `stronie domowej Tcl/Tk <https://www.tcl.tk>`_.  Tcl/Tk jest w pełni "
"przenośny na platformy macOS, Windows i Unix."

msgid "How do I freeze Tkinter applications?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Freeze is a tool to create stand-alone applications.  When freezing Tkinter "
"applications, the applications will not be truly stand-alone, as the "
"application will still need the Tcl and Tk libraries."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One solution is to ship the application with the Tcl and Tk libraries, and "
"point to them at run-time using the :envvar:`!TCL_LIBRARY` and :envvar:`!"
"TK_LIBRARY` environment variables."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Various third-party freeze libraries such as py2exe and cx_Freeze have "
"handling for Tkinter applications built-in."
msgstr ""

msgid "Can I have Tk events handled while waiting for I/O?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On platforms other than Windows, yes, and you don't even need threads!  But "
"you'll have to restructure your I/O code a bit.  Tk has the equivalent of "
"Xt's :c:func:`!XtAddInput` call, which allows you to register a callback "
"function which will be called from the Tk mainloop when I/O is possible on a "
"file descriptor.  See :ref:`tkinter-file-handlers`."
msgstr ""

msgid "I can't get key bindings to work in Tkinter: why?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An often-heard complaint is that event handlers :ref:`bound <bindings-and-"
"events>` to events with the :meth:`!bind` method don't get handled even when "
"the appropriate key is pressed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The most common cause is that the widget to which the binding applies "
"doesn't have \"keyboard focus\".  Check out the Tk documentation for the "
"focus command. Usually a widget is given the keyboard focus by clicking in "
"it (but not for labels; see the takefocus option)."
