"`The Linux perf profiler <https://perf.wiki.kernel.org>`_ is a very powerful "
"tool that allows you to profile and obtain information about the performance "
"of your application. ``perf`` also has a very vibrant ecosystem of tools "
"that aid with the analysis of the data that it produces."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The main problem with using the ``perf`` profiler with Python applications "
"is that ``perf`` only gets information about native symbols, that is, the "
"names of functions and procedures written in C. This means that the names "
"and file names of Python functions in your code will not appear in the "
"output of ``perf``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since Python 3.12, the interpreter can run in a special mode that allows "
"Python functions to appear in the output of the ``perf`` profiler. When this "
"mode is enabled, the interpreter will interpose a small piece of code "
"compiled on the fly before the execution of every Python function and it "
"will teach ``perf`` the relationship between this piece of code and the "
"associated Python function using :doc:`perf map files <../c-api/perfmaps>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for the ``perf`` profiler is currently only available for Linux on "
"select architectures. Check the output of the ``configure`` build step or "
"check the output of ``python -m sysconfig | grep HAVE_PERF_TRAMPOLINE`` to "
"see if your system is supported."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, consider the following script:"

"def foo(n):\n"
