"`The Linux perf profiler <https://perf.wiki.kernel.org>`_ is a very powerful "
"tool that allows you to profile and obtain information about the performance "
"of your application. ``perf`` also has a very vibrant ecosystem of tools "
"that aid with the analysis of the data that it produces."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The main problem with using the ``perf`` profiler with Python applications "
"is that ``perf`` only gets information about native symbols, that is, the "
"names of functions and procedures written in C. This means that the names "
"and file names of Python functions in your code will not appear in the "
"output of ``perf``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since Python 3.12, the interpreter can run in a special mode that allows "
"Python functions to appear in the output of the ``perf`` profiler. When this "
"mode is enabled, the interpreter will interpose a small piece of code "
"compiled on the fly before the execution of every Python function and it "
"will teach ``perf`` the relationship between this piece of code and the "
"associated Python function using :doc:`perf map files <../c-api/perfmaps>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for the ``perf`` profiler is currently only available for Linux on "
"select architectures. Check the output of the ``configure`` build step or "
"check the output of ``python -m sysconfig | grep HAVE_PERF_TRAMPOLINE`` to "
"see if your system is supported."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, consider the following script:"
msgstr ""

msgid "We can run ``perf`` to sample CPU stack traces at 9999 hertz::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Then we can use ``perf report`` to analyze the data:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you can see, the Python functions are not shown in the output, only "
"``_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault`` (the function that evaluates the Python "
"bytecode) shows up. Unfortunately that's not very useful because all Python "
"functions use the same C function to evaluate bytecode so we cannot know "
"which Python function corresponds to which bytecode-evaluating function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead, if we run the same experiment with ``perf`` support enabled we get:"
msgstr ""

msgid "How to enable ``perf`` profiling support"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``perf`` profiling support can be enabled either from the start using the "
"environment variable :envvar:`PYTHONPERFSUPPORT` or the :option:`-X perf <-"
"X>` option, or dynamically using :func:`sys.activate_stack_trampoline` and :"
"func:`sys.deactivate_stack_trampoline`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`!sys` functions take precedence over the :option:`!-X` option, "
"the :option:`!-X` option takes precedence over the environment variable."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example, using the environment variable::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Example, using the :option:`!-X` option::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Example, using the :mod:`sys` APIs in file :file:`example.py`:"
msgstr ""

msgid "...then::"
msgstr ""

msgid "How to obtain the best results"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For best results, Python should be compiled with ``CFLAGS=\"-fno-omit-frame-"
"pointer -mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer\"`` as this allows profilers to unwind "
"using only the frame pointer and not on DWARF debug information. This is "
"because as the code that is interposed to allow ``perf`` support is "
"dynamically generated it doesn't have any DWARF debugging information "
"available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can check if your system has been compiled with this flag by running::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't see any output it means that your interpreter has not been "
"compiled with frame pointers and therefore it may not be able to show Python "
"functions in the output of ``perf``."
msgstr ""

msgid "How to work without frame pointers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are working with a Python interpreter that has been compiled without "
"frame pointers, you can still use the ``perf`` profiler, but the overhead "
"will be a bit higher because Python needs to generate unwinding information "
"for every Python function call on the fly. Additionally, ``perf`` will take "
"more time to process the data because it will need to use the DWARF "
"debugging information to unwind the stack and this is a slow process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To enable this mode, you can use the environment variable :envvar:"
"`PYTHON_PERF_JIT_SUPPORT` or the :option:`-X perf_jit <-X>` option, which "
"will enable the JIT mode for the ``perf`` profiler."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to a bug in the ``perf`` tool, only ``perf`` versions higher than v6.8 "
"will work with the JIT mode.  The fix was also backported to the v6.7.2 "
"version of the tool."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that when checking the version of the ``perf`` tool (which can be done "
"by running ``perf version``) you must take into account that some distros "
"add some custom version numbers including a ``-`` character.  This means "
"that ``perf 6.7-3`` is not necessarily ``perf 6.7.3``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When using the perf JIT mode, you need an extra step before you can run "
"``perf report``. You need to call the ``perf inject`` command to inject the "
"JIT information into the ``perf.data`` file.::"
msgstr ""

msgid "or using the environment variable::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``perf inject --jit`` command will read ``perf.data``, automatically pick up "
"the perf dump file that Python creates (in ``/tmp/perf-$PID.dump``), and "
"then create ``perf.jit.data`` which merges all the JIT information together. "
"It should also create a lot of ``jitted-XXXX-N.so`` files in the current "
"directory which are ELF images for all the JIT trampolines that were created "
"by Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice that when using ``--call-graph dwarf`` the ``perf`` tool will take "
"snapshots of the stack of the process being profiled and save the "
"information in the ``perf.data`` file. By default the size of the stack dump "
"is 8192 bytes but the user can change the size by passing the size after "
"comma like ``--call-graph dwarf,4096``. The size of the stack dump is "
"important because if the size is too small ``perf`` will not be able to "
"unwind the stack and the output will be incomplete. On the other hand, if "
"the size is too big, then ``perf`` won't be able to sample the process as "
"frequently as it would like as the overhead will be higher."
