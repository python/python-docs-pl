msgid "Debugging C API extensions and CPython Internals with GDB"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This document explains how the Python GDB extension, ``python-gdb.py``, can "
"be used with the GDB debugger to debug CPython extensions and the CPython "
"interpreter itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When debugging low-level problems such as crashes or deadlocks, a low-level "
"debugger, such as GDB, is useful to diagnose and correct the issue. By "
"default, GDB (or any of its front-ends) doesn't support high-level "
"information specific to the CPython interpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``python-gdb.py`` extension adds CPython interpreter information to GDB. "
"The extension helps introspect the stack of currently executing Python "
"functions. Given a Python object represented by a :c:expr:`PyObject *` "
"pointer, the extension surfaces the type and value of the object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Developers who are working on CPython extensions or tinkering with parts of "
"CPython that are written in C can use this document to learn how to use the "
"``python-gdb.py`` extension with GDB."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This document assumes that you are familiar with the basics of GDB and the "
"CPython C API. It consolidates guidance from the `devguide <https://devguide."
"python.org>`_  and the `Python wiki <https://wiki.python.org/moin/"
"DebuggingWithGdb>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Prerequisites"
msgstr ""

msgid "You need to have:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDB 7 or later. (For earlier versions of GDB, see ``Misc/gdbinit`` in the "
"sources of Python 3.11 or earlier.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDB-compatible debugging information for Python and any extension you are "
"debugging."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``python-gdb.py`` extension."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The extension is built with Python, but might be distributed separately or "
"not at all. Below, we include tips for a few common systems as examples. "
"Note that even if the instructions match your system, they might be outdated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setup with Python built from source"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you build CPython from source, debugging information should be "
"available, and the build should add a ``python-gdb.py`` file to the root "
"directory of your repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To activate support, you must add the directory containing ``python-gdb.py`` "
"to GDB's \"auto-load-safe-path\". If you haven't done this, recent versions "
"of GDB will print out a warning with instructions on how to do this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you do not see instructions for your version of GDB, put this in your "
"configuration file (``~/.gdbinit`` or ``~/.config/gdb/gdbinit``)::"
msgstr ""

msgid "add-auto-load-safe-path /path/to/cpython"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also add multiple paths, separated by ``:``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setup for Python from a Linux distro"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most Linux systems provide debug information for the system Python in a "
"package called ``python-debuginfo``, ``python-dbg`` or similar. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Fedora:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"sudo dnf install gdb\n"
"sudo dnf debuginfo-install python3"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ubuntu:"
msgstr ""

msgid "sudo apt install gdb python3-dbg"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On several recent Linux systems, GDB can download debugging symbols "
"automatically using *debuginfod*. However, this will not install the "
"``python-gdb.py`` extension; you generally do need to install the debug info "
"package separately."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using the Debug build and Development mode"
msgstr ""

msgid "For easier debugging, you might want to:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use a :ref:`debug build <debug-build>` of Python. (When building from "
"source, use ``configure --with-pydebug``. On Linux distros, install and run "
"a package like ``python-debug`` or ``python-dbg``, if available.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use the runtime :ref:`development mode <devmode>` (``-X dev``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both enable extra assertions and disable some optimizations. Sometimes this "
"hides the bug you are trying to find, but in most cases they make the "
"process easier."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using the ``python-gdb`` extension"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the extension is loaded, it provides two main features: pretty printers "
"for Python values, and additional commands."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pretty-printers"
