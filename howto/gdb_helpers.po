msgid "Debugging C API extensions and CPython Internals with GDB"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This document explains how the Python GDB extension, ``python-gdb.py``, can "
"be used with the GDB debugger to debug CPython extensions and the CPython "
"interpreter itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When debugging low-level problems such as crashes or deadlocks, a low-level "
"debugger, such as GDB, is useful to diagnose and correct the issue. By "
"default, GDB (or any of its front-ends) doesn't support high-level "
"information specific to the CPython interpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``python-gdb.py`` extension adds CPython interpreter information to GDB. "
"The extension helps introspect the stack of currently executing Python "
"functions. Given a Python object represented by a :c:expr:`PyObject *` "
"pointer, the extension surfaces the type and value of the object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Developers who are working on CPython extensions or tinkering with parts of "
"CPython that are written in C can use this document to learn how to use the "
"``python-gdb.py`` extension with GDB."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This document assumes that you are familiar with the basics of GDB and the "
"CPython C API. It consolidates guidance from the `devguide <https://devguide."
"python.org>`_  and the `Python wiki <https://wiki.python.org/moin/"
"DebuggingWithGdb>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Prerequisites"
msgstr ""

msgid "You need to have:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDB 7 or later. (For earlier versions of GDB, see ``Misc/gdbinit`` in the "
"CPython sources. Note that this file will be removed in Python 3.12.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDB-compatible debugging information for Python and any extension you are "
"debugging."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``python-gdb.py`` extension."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The extension is built with Python, but might be distributed separately or "
"not at all. Below, we include tips for a few common systems as examples. "
"Note that even if the instructions match your system, they might be outdated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setup with Python built from source"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you build CPython from source, debugging information should be "
"available, and the build should add a ``python-gdb.py`` file to the root "
"directory of your repository."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To activate support, you must add the directory containing ``python-gdb.py`` "
"to GDB's \"auto-load-safe-path\". If you haven't done this, recent versions "
"of GDB will print out a warning with instructions on how to do this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you do not see instructions for your version of GDB, put this in your "
"configuration file (``~/.gdbinit`` or ``~/.config/gdb/gdbinit``)::"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also add multiple paths, separated by ``:``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Setup for Python from a Linux distro"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most Linux systems provide debug information for the system Python in a "
"package called ``python-debuginfo``, ``python-dbg`` or similar. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Fedora:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ubuntu:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On several recent Linux systems, GDB can download debugging symbols "
"automatically using *debuginfod*. However, this will not install the "
"``python-gdb.py`` extension; you generally do need to install the debug info "
"package separately."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using the Debug build and Development mode"
msgstr ""

msgid "For easier debugging, you might want to:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use a :ref:`debug build <debug-build>` of Python. (When building from "
"source, use ``configure --with-pydebug``. On Linux distros, install and run "
"a package like ``python-debug`` or ``python-dbg``, if available.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use the runtime :ref:`development mode <devmode>` (``-X dev``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both enable extra assertions and disable some optimizations. Sometimes this "
"hides the bug you are trying to find, but in most cases they make the "
"process easier."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using the ``python-gdb`` extension"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the extension is loaded, it provides two main features: pretty printers "
"for Python values, and additional commands."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pretty-printers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is what a GDB backtrace looks like (truncated) when this extension is "
"enabled::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice how the dictionary argument to ``PyDict_GetItemString`` is displayed "
"as its ``repr()``, rather than an opaque ``PyObject *`` pointer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The extension works by supplying a custom printing routine for values of "
"type ``PyObject *``.  If you need to access lower-level details of an "
"object, then cast the value to a pointer of the appropriate type.  For "
"example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the pretty-printers do not actually call ``repr()``. For basic "
"types, they try to match its result closely."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An area that can be confusing is that the custom printer for some types look "
"a lot like GDB's built-in printer for standard types.  For example, the "
"pretty-printer for a Python ``int`` (:c:expr:`PyLongObject *`) gives a "
"representation that is not distinguishable from one of a regular machine-"
"level integer::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The internal structure can be revealed with a cast to :c:expr:`PyLongObject "
"*`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"(gdb) p *(PyLongObject*)some_python_integer $5 = {ob_base = {ob_base = "
"{ob_refcnt = 8, ob_type = 0x3dad39f5e0}, ob_size = 1}, ob_digit = {42}}"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A similar confusion can arise with the ``str`` type, where the output looks "
"a lot like gdb's built-in printer for ``char *``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The pretty-printer for ``str`` instances defaults to using single-quotes (as "
"does Python's ``repr`` for strings) whereas the standard printer for ``char "
"*`` values uses double-quotes and contains a hexadecimal address::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Again, the implementation details can be revealed with a cast to :c:expr:"
"`PyUnicodeObject *`::"
msgstr ""

msgid "``py-list``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The extension adds a ``py-list`` command, which lists the Python source code "
"(if any) for the current frame in the selected thread.  The current line is "
"marked with a \">\"::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use ``py-list START`` to list at a different line number within the Python "
"source, and ``py-list START,END`` to list a specific range of lines within "
"the Python source."
msgstr ""

msgid "``py-up`` and ``py-down``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``py-up`` and ``py-down`` commands are analogous to GDB's regular ``up`` "
"and ``down`` commands, but try to move at the level of CPython frames, "
"rather than C frames."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDB is not always able to read the relevant frame information, depending on "
"the optimization level with which CPython was compiled. Internally, the "
"commands look for C frames that are executing the default frame evaluation "
"function (that is, the core bytecode interpreter loop within CPython) and "
"look up the value of the related ``PyFrameObject *``."
msgstr ""

msgid "They emit the frame number (at the C level) within the thread."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example::"
msgstr "Dla przykładu::"

msgid "so we're at the top of the Python stack."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The frame numbers correspond to those displayed by GDB's standard "
"``backtrace`` command. The command skips C frames which are not executing "
"Python code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Going back down::"
msgstr ""

msgid "and we're at the bottom of the Python stack."
msgstr ""

msgid "``py-bt``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``py-bt`` command attempts to display a Python-level backtrace of the "
"current thread."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The frame numbers correspond to those displayed by GDB's standard "
"``backtrace`` command."
msgstr ""

msgid "``py-print``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``py-print`` command looks up a Python name and tries to print it. It "
"looks in locals within the current thread, then globals, then finally "
"builtins::"
msgstr ""

msgid "``py-locals``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``py-locals`` command looks up all Python locals within the current "
"Python frame in the selected thread, and prints their representations::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Use with GDB commands"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The extension commands complement GDB's built-in commands. For example, you "
"can use a frame numbers shown by ``py-bt`` with the ``frame`` command to go "
"a specific frame within the selected thread, like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``info threads`` command will give you a list of the threads within the "
"process, and you can use the ``thread`` command to select a different one::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use ``thread apply all COMMAND`` or (``t a a COMMAND`` for short) to "
"run a command on all threads.  With ``py-bt``, this lets you see what every "
"thread is doing at the Python level::"
msgstr ""
