"DTrace and SystemTap are monitoring tools, each providing a way to inspect "
"what the processes on a computer system are doing.  They both use domain-"
"specific languages allowing a user to write scripts which:"

"As of Python 3.6, CPython can be built with embedded \"markers\", also known "
"as \"probes\", that can be observed by a DTrace or SystemTap script, making "
"it easier to monitor what the CPython processes on a system are doing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"DTrace markers are implementation details of the CPython interpreter. No "
"guarantees are made about probe compatibility between versions of CPython. "
"DTrace scripts can stop working or work incorrectly without warning when "
"changing CPython versions."

msgid "Enabling the static markers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"macOS comes with built-in support for DTrace.  On Linux, in order to build "
"CPython with the embedded markers for SystemTap, the SystemTap development "
"tools must be installed."
msgstr ""

msgid "On a Linux machine, this can be done via::"
msgstr "Na Linuksie może to być wykonane przez::"

msgid "or::"
msgstr "lub::"

msgid ""
"CPython must then be :option:`configured with the --with-dtrace option <--"
"with-dtrace>`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On macOS, you can list available DTrace probes by running a Python process "
"in the background and listing all probes made available by the Python "
"provider::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Linux, you can verify if the SystemTap static markers are present in the "
"built binary by seeing if it contains a \".note.stapsdt\" section."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you've built Python as a shared library (with the :option:`--enable-"
"shared` configure option), you need to look instead within the shared "
"library.  For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sufficiently modern readelf can print the metadata::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above metadata contains information for SystemTap describing how it can "
"patch strategically placed machine code instructions to enable the tracing "
"hooks used by a SystemTap script."

msgid "Static DTrace probes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following example DTrace script can be used to show the call/return "
"hierarchy of a Python script, only tracing within the invocation of a "
"function called \"start\". In other words, import-time function invocations "
"are not going to be listed:"

msgid "Static SystemTap markers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The low-level way to use the SystemTap integration is to use the static "
"markers directly.  This requires you to explicitly state the binary file "
"containing them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, this SystemTap script can be used to show the call/return "
"hierarchy of a Python script:"
msgstr ""

msgid "where the columns are:"
msgstr ""

msgid "time in microseconds since start of script"
msgstr ""

msgid "name of executable"
msgstr ""

msgid "PID of process"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"and the remainder indicates the call/return hierarchy as the script executes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a :option:`--enable-shared` build of CPython, the markers are contained "
"within the libpython shared library, and the probe's dotted path needs to "
"reflect this. For example, this line from the above example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "should instead read:"

"This marker indicates that execution of a Python function has begun. It is "
"only triggered for pure-Python (bytecode) functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The filename, function name, and line number are provided back to the "
"tracing script as positional arguments, which must be accessed using "
"``$arg1``, ``$arg2``, ``$arg3``:"

"``$arg1`` : ``(const char *)`` filename, accessible using "

"``user_string($arg2)``"

msgid ""
"This marker is the converse of :c:func:`function__entry`, and indicates that "

"exception).  It is only triggered for pure-Python (bytecode) functions."
msgstr ""

msgid "The arguments are the same as for :c:func:`function__entry`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This marker indicates a Python line is about to be executed.  It is the "

"Fires when the Python interpreter finishes a garbage collection cycle. "
"``arg0`` is the number of collected objects."

msgid ""
"Fires before :mod:`importlib` attempts to find and load the module. ``arg0`` "
"is the module name."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The higher-level way to use the SystemTap integration is to use a "
"\"tapset\": SystemTap's equivalent of a library, which hides some of the "
"lower-level details of the static markers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is a tapset file, based on a non-shared build of CPython:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this file is installed in SystemTap's tapset directory (e.g. ``/usr/share/"

"This probe point indicates that execution of a Python function has begun. It "
"is only triggered for pure-Python (bytecode) functions."
