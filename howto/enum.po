msgid "Enum HOWTO"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An :class:`Enum` is a set of symbolic names bound to unique values.  They "
"are similar to global variables, but they offer a more useful :func:"
"`repr()`, grouping, type-safety, and a few other features."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They are most useful when you have a variable that can take one of a limited "
"selection of values.  For example, the days of the week::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Or perhaps the RGB primary colors::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you can see, creating an :class:`Enum` is as simple as writing a class "
"that inherits from :class:`Enum` itself."
msgstr ""

msgid "Case of Enum Members"
msgstr "Wielkość liter literałów wyliczeniowych"

msgid ""
"Because Enums are used to represent constants we recommend using UPPER_CASE "
"names for members, and will be using that style in our examples."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Depending on the nature of the enum a member's value may or may not be "
"important, but either way that value can be used to get the corresponding "
"member::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you can see, the ``repr()`` of a member shows the enum name, the member "
"name, and the value.  The ``str()`` of a member shows only the enum name and "
"member name::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The *type* of an enumeration member is the enum it belongs to::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enum members have an attribute that contains just their :attr:`name`::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Likewise, they have an attribute for their :attr:`value`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike many languages that treat enumerations solely as name/value pairs, "
"Python Enums can have behavior added.  For example, :class:`datetime.date` "
"has two methods for returning the weekday: :meth:`weekday` and :meth:"
"`isoweekday`. The difference is that one of them counts from 0-6 and the "
"other from 1-7. Rather than keep track of that ourselves we can add a method "
"to the :class:`Weekday` enum to extract the day from the :class:`date` "
"instance and return the matching enum member::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The complete :class:`Weekday` enum now looks like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Now we can find out what today is!  Observe::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Of course, if you're reading this on some other day, you'll see that day "
"instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This :class:`Weekday` enum is great if our variable only needs one day, but "
"what if we need several?  Maybe we're writing a function to plot chores "
"during a week, and don't want to use a :class:`list` -- we could use a "
"different type of :class:`Enum`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We've changed two things: we're inherited from :class:`Flag`, and the values "
"are all powers of 2."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Just like the original :class:`Weekday` enum above, we can have a single "
"selection::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"But :class:`Flag` also allows us to combine several members into a single "
"variable::"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can even iterate over a :class:`Flag` variable::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Okay, let's get some chores set up::"
msgstr ""

msgid "And a function to display the chores for a given day::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In cases where the actual values of the members do not matter, you can save "
"yourself some work and use :func:`auto()` for the values::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Programmatic access to enumeration members and their attributes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes it's useful to access members in enumerations programmatically (i."
"e. situations where ``Color.RED`` won't do because the exact color is not "
"known at program-writing time).  ``Enum`` allows such access::"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you want to access enum members by *name*, use item access::"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you have an enum member and need its :attr:`name` or :attr:`value`::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Duplicating enum members and values"
msgstr ""

msgid "Having two enum members with the same name is invalid::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, an enum member can have other names associated with it.  Given two "
"entries ``A`` and ``B`` with the same value (and ``A`` defined first), ``B`` "
"is an alias for the member ``A``.  By-value lookup of the value of ``A`` "
"will return the member ``A``.  By-name lookup of ``A`` will return the "
"member ``A``. By-name lookup of ``B`` will also return the member ``A``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Attempting to create a member with the same name as an already defined "
"attribute (another member, a method, etc.) or attempting to create an "
"attribute with the same name as a member is not allowed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ensuring unique enumeration values"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, enumerations allow multiple names as aliases for the same value. "
"When this behavior isn't desired, you can use the :func:`unique` decorator::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using automatic values"
msgstr ""

msgid "If the exact value is unimportant you can use :class:`auto`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The values are chosen by :func:`_generate_next_value_`, which can be "
"overridden::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :meth:`_generate_next_value_` method must be defined before any members."
msgstr ""

msgid "Iteration"
msgstr ""

msgid "Iterating over the members of an enum does not provide the aliases::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the aliases ``Shape.ALIAS_FOR_SQUARE`` and ``Weekday.WEEKEND`` "
"aren't shown."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The special attribute ``__members__`` is a read-only ordered mapping of "
"names to members.  It includes all names defined in the enumeration, "
"including the aliases::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``__members__`` attribute can be used for detailed programmatic access "
"to the enumeration members.  For example, finding all the aliases::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Aliases for flags include values with multiple flags set, such as ``3``, and "
"no flags set, i.e. ``0``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Comparisons"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enumeration members are compared by identity::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ordered comparisons between enumeration values are *not* supported.  Enum "
"members are not integers (but see `IntEnum`_ below)::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Equality comparisons are defined though::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Comparisons against non-enumeration values will always compare not equal "
"(again, :class:`IntEnum` was explicitly designed to behave differently, see "
"below)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to reload modules -- if a reloaded module contains enums, "
"they will be recreated, and the new members may not compare identical/equal "
"to the original members."
msgstr ""

msgid "Allowed members and attributes of enumerations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most of the examples above use integers for enumeration values.  Using "
"integers is short and handy (and provided by default by the `Functional "
"API`_), but not strictly enforced.  In the vast majority of use-cases, one "
"doesn't care what the actual value of an enumeration is.  But if the value "
"*is* important, enumerations can have arbitrary values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enumerations are Python classes, and can have methods and special methods as "
"usual.  If we have this enumeration::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Then::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The rules for what is allowed are as follows: names that start and end with "
"a single underscore are reserved by enum and cannot be used; all other "
"attributes defined within an enumeration will become members of this "
"enumeration, with the exception of special methods (:meth:`__str__`, :meth:"
"`__add__`, etc.), descriptors (methods are also descriptors), and variable "
"names listed in :attr:`_ignore_`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note:  if your enumeration defines :meth:`__new__` and/or :meth:`__init__` "
"then any value(s) given to the enum member will be passed into those "
"methods. See `Planet`_ for an example."
msgstr ""

msgid "Restricted Enum subclassing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A new :class:`Enum` class must have one base enum class, up to one concrete "
"data type, and as many :class:`object`-based mixin classes as needed.  The "
"order of these base classes is::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, subclassing an enumeration is allowed only if the enumeration does not "
"define any members.  So this is forbidden::"
msgstr ""

msgid "But this is allowed::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Allowing subclassing of enums that define members would lead to a violation "
"of some important invariants of types and instances.  On the other hand, it "
"makes sense to allow sharing some common behavior between a group of "
"enumerations. (See `OrderedEnum`_ for an example.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pickling"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enumerations can be pickled and unpickled::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The usual restrictions for pickling apply: picklable enums must be defined "
"in the top level of a module, since unpickling requires them to be "
"importable from that module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With pickle protocol version 4 it is possible to easily pickle enums nested "
"in other classes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to modify how enum members are pickled/unpickled by defining :"
"meth:`__reduce_ex__` in the enumeration class."
msgstr ""

msgid "Functional API"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`Enum` class is callable, providing the following functional API::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The semantics of this API resemble :class:`~collections.namedtuple`. The "
"first argument of the call to :class:`Enum` is the name of the enumeration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second argument is the *source* of enumeration member names.  It can be "
"a whitespace-separated string of names, a sequence of names, a sequence of 2-"
"tuples with key/value pairs, or a mapping (e.g. dictionary) of names to "
"values.  The last two options enable assigning arbitrary values to "
"enumerations; the others auto-assign increasing integers starting with 1 "
"(use the ``start`` parameter to specify a different starting value).  A new "
"class derived from :class:`Enum` is returned.  In other words, the above "
"assignment to :class:`Animal` is equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The reason for defaulting to ``1`` as the starting number and not ``0`` is "
"that ``0`` is ``False`` in a boolean sense, but by default enum members all "
"evaluate to ``True``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pickling enums created with the functional API can be tricky as frame stack "
"implementation details are used to try and figure out which module the "
"enumeration is being created in (e.g. it will fail if you use a utility "
"function in a separate module, and also may not work on IronPython or "
"Jython). The solution is to specify the module name explicitly as follows::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``module`` is not supplied, and Enum cannot determine what it is, the new "
"Enum members will not be unpicklable; to keep errors closer to the source, "
"pickling will be disabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The new pickle protocol 4 also, in some circumstances, relies on :attr:"
"`~definition.__qualname__` being set to the location where pickle will be "
"able to find the class.  For example, if the class was made available in "
"class SomeData in the global scope::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The complete signature is::"
msgstr ""

msgid "value"
msgstr ""

msgid "What the new enum class will record as its name."
msgstr ""

msgid "names"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The enum members.  This can be a whitespace- or comma-separated string "
"(values will start at 1 unless otherwise specified)::"
msgstr ""

msgid "or an iterator of names::"
msgstr ""

msgid "or an iterator of (name, value) pairs::"
msgstr ""

msgid "or a mapping::"
msgstr ""

msgid "module"
msgstr "moduł"

msgid "name of module where new enum class can be found."
msgstr ""

msgid "qualname"
msgstr ""

msgid "where in module new enum class can be found."
msgstr ""

msgid "type"
msgstr ""

msgid "type to mix in to new enum class."
msgstr ""

msgid "start"
msgstr ""

msgid "number to start counting at if only names are passed in."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *start* parameter was added."
msgstr ""

msgid "Derived Enumerations"
msgstr ""

msgid "IntEnum"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first variation of :class:`Enum` that is provided is also a subclass of :"
"class:`int`.  Members of an :class:`IntEnum` can be compared to integers; by "
"extension, integer enumerations of different types can also be compared to "
"each other::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, they still can't be compared to standard :class:`Enum` "
"enumerations::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`IntEnum` values behave like integers in other ways you'd expect::"
msgstr ""

msgid "StrEnum"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second variation of :class:`Enum` that is provided is also a subclass "
"of :class:`str`.  Members of a :class:`StrEnum` can be compared to strings; "
"by extension, string enumerations of different types can also be compared to "
"each other."
msgstr ""

msgid "IntFlag"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The next variation of :class:`Enum` provided, :class:`IntFlag`, is also "
"based on :class:`int`.  The difference being :class:`IntFlag` members can be "
"combined using the bitwise operators (&, \\|, ^, ~) and the result is still "
"an :class:`IntFlag` member, if possible.  Like :class:`IntEnum`, :class:"
"`IntFlag` members are also integers and can be used wherever an :class:`int` "
"is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any operation on an :class:`IntFlag` member besides the bit-wise operations "
"will lose the :class:`IntFlag` membership."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bit-wise operations that result in invalid :class:`IntFlag` values will lose "
"the :class:`IntFlag` membership.  See :class:`FlagBoundary` for details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sample :class:`IntFlag` class::"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is also possible to name the combinations::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Named combinations are considered aliases.  Aliases do not show up during "
"iteration, but can be returned from by-value lookups."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another important difference between :class:`IntFlag` and :class:`Enum` is "
"that if no flags are set (the value is 0), its boolean evaluation is :data:"
"`False`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because :class:`IntFlag` members are also subclasses of :class:`int` they "
"can be combined with them (but may lose :class:`IntFlag` membership::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The negation operator, ``~``, always returns an :class:`IntFlag` member with "
"a positive value::"
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`IntFlag` members can also be iterated over::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Flag"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The last variation is :class:`Flag`.  Like :class:`IntFlag`, :class:`Flag` "
"members can be combined using the bitwise operators (&, \\|, ^, ~).  Unlike :"
"class:`IntFlag`, they cannot be combined with, nor compared against, any "
"other :class:`Flag` enumeration, nor :class:`int`.  While it is possible to "
"specify the values directly it is recommended to use :class:`auto` as the "
"value and let :class:`Flag` select an appropriate value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like :class:`IntFlag`, if a combination of :class:`Flag` members results in "
"no flags being set, the boolean evaluation is :data:`False`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Individual flags should have values that are powers of two (1, 2, 4, "
"8, ...), while combinations of flags will not::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Giving a name to the \"no flags set\" condition does not change its boolean "
"value::"
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`Flag` members can also be iterated over::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the majority of new code, :class:`Enum` and :class:`Flag` are strongly "
"recommended, since :class:`IntEnum` and :class:`IntFlag` break some semantic "
"promises of an enumeration (by being comparable to integers, and thus by "
"transitivity to other unrelated enumerations).  :class:`IntEnum` and :class:"
"`IntFlag` should be used only in cases where :class:`Enum` and :class:`Flag` "
"will not do; for example, when integer constants are replaced with "
"enumerations, or for interoperability with other systems."
msgstr ""

msgid "Others"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While :class:`IntEnum` is part of the :mod:`enum` module, it would be very "
"simple to implement independently::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This demonstrates how similar derived enumerations can be defined; for "
"example a :class:`FloatEnum` that mixes in :class:`float` instead of :class:"
"`int`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some rules:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When subclassing :class:`Enum`, mix-in types must appear before :class:"
"`Enum` itself in the sequence of bases, as in the :class:`IntEnum` example "
"above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mix-in types must be subclassable. For example, :class:`bool` and :class:"
"`range` are not subclassable and will throw an error during Enum creation if "
"used as the mix-in type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While :class:`Enum` can have members of any type, once you mix in an "
"additional type, all the members must have values of that type, e.g. :class:"
"`int` above.  This restriction does not apply to mix-ins which only add "
"methods and don't specify another type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When another data type is mixed in, the :attr:`value` attribute is *not the "
"same* as the enum member itself, although it is equivalent and will compare "
"equal."
msgstr ""

msgid "A ``data type`` is a mixin that defines :meth:`__new__`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"%-style formatting:  ``%s`` and ``%r`` call the :class:`Enum` class's :meth:"
"`__str__` and :meth:`__repr__` respectively; other codes (such as ``%i`` or "
"``%h`` for IntEnum) treat the enum member as its mixed-in type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Formatted string literals <f-strings>`, :meth:`str.format`, and :func:"
"`format` will use the enum's :meth:`__str__` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because :class:`IntEnum`, :class:`IntFlag`, and :class:`StrEnum` are "
"designed to be drop-in replacements for existing constants, their :meth:"
"`__str__` method has been reset to their data types' :meth:`__str__` method."
msgstr ""

msgid "When to use :meth:`__new__` vs. :meth:`__init__`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`__new__` must be used whenever you want to customize the actual value "
"of the :class:`Enum` member.  Any other modifications may go in either :meth:"
"`__new__` or :meth:`__init__`, with :meth:`__init__` being preferred."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, if you want to pass several items to the constructor, but only "
"want one of them to be the value::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Finer Points"
msgstr ""

msgid "Supported ``__dunder__`` names"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":attr:`__members__` is a read-only ordered mapping of ``member_name``:"
"``member`` items.  It is only available on the class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`__new__`, if specified, must create and return the enum members; it "
"is also a very good idea to set the member's :attr:`_value_` appropriately.  "
"Once all the members are created it is no longer used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Supported ``_sunder_`` names"
msgstr ""

"``_missing_`` -- a lookup function used when a value is not found; may be "
"overridden"

"`str`, that will not be transformed into members, and will be removed from "
"the final class"
msgstr ""
