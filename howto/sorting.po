"Python lists have a built-in :meth:`list.sort` method that modifies the list "
"in-place.  There is also a :func:`sorted` built-in function that builds a "
"new sorted list from an iterable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this document, we explore the various techniques for sorting data using "
"Python."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sorting Basics"
msgstr "Podstawy sortowania"

msgid ""
"A simple ascending sort is very easy: just call the :func:`sorted` function. "
"It returns a new sorted list:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also use the :meth:`list.sort` method. It modifies the list in-place "
"(and returns ``None`` to avoid confusion). Usually it's less convenient "
"than :func:`sorted` - but if you don't need the original list, it's slightly "
"more efficient."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another difference is that the :meth:`list.sort` method is only defined for "
"lists. In contrast, the :func:`sorted` function accepts any iterable."
msgstr ""

msgid "Key Functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both :meth:`list.sort` and :func:`sorted` have a *key* parameter to specify "
"a function (or other callable) to be called on each list element prior to "
"making comparisons."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, here's a case-insensitive string comparison:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The value of the *key* parameter should be a function (or other callable) "
"that takes a single argument and returns a key to use for sorting purposes. "
"This technique is fast because the key function is called exactly once for "
"each input record."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common pattern is to sort complex objects using some of the object's "
"indices as keys. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same technique works for objects with named attributes. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Operator Module Functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The key-function patterns shown above are very common, so Python provides "
"convenience functions to make accessor functions easier and faster. The :mod:"
"`operator` module has :func:`~operator.itemgetter`, :func:`~operator."
"attrgetter`, and a :func:`~operator.methodcaller` function."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using those functions, the above examples become simpler and faster:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The operator module functions allow multiple levels of sorting. For example, "
"to sort by *grade* then by *age*:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ascending and Descending"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both :meth:`list.sort` and :func:`sorted` accept a *reverse* parameter with "
"a boolean value. This is used to flag descending sorts. For example, to get "
"the student data in reverse *age* order:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sort Stability and Complex Sorts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sorts are guaranteed to be `stable <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Sorting_algorithm#Stability>`_\\. That means that when multiple records have "
"the same key, their original order is preserved."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Notice how the two records for *blue* retain their original order so that "
"``('blue', 1)`` is guaranteed to precede ``('blue', 2)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This wonderful property lets you build complex sorts in a series of sorting "
"steps. For example, to sort the student data by descending *grade* and then "
"ascending *age*, do the *age* sort first and then sort again using *grade*:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This can be abstracted out into a wrapper function that can take a list and "
"tuples of field and order to sort them on multiple passes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Timsort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort>`_ algorithm used in "
"Python does multiple sorts efficiently because it can take advantage of any "
"ordering already present in a dataset."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Old Way Using Decorate-Sort-Undecorate"
msgstr ""

msgid "This idiom is called Decorate-Sort-Undecorate after its three steps:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, the initial list is decorated with new values that control the sort "
"order."
msgstr ""

msgid "Second, the decorated list is sorted."
msgstr "Po drugie, decorated list jest posortowana"

msgid ""
"Finally, the decorations are removed, creating a list that contains only the "
"initial values in the new order."
msgstr ""
"Podsumowując, dekoratory są usunięte, stworzona lista zawiera tylko wartości "
"początkowe, których kolejność jest posortowana."

msgid ""
"For example, to sort the student data by *grade* using the DSU approach:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This idiom works because tuples are compared lexicographically; the first "
"items are compared; if they are the same then the second items are compared, "
"and so on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is not strictly necessary in all cases to include the index *i* in the "
"decorated list, but including it gives two benefits:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The sort is stable -- if two items have the same key, their order will be "
"preserved in the sorted list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The original items do not have to be comparable because the ordering of the "
"decorated tuples will be determined by at most the first two items. So for "
"example the original list could contain complex numbers which cannot be "
"sorted directly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another name for this idiom is `Schwartzian transform <https://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform>`_\\, after Randal L. Schwartz, who "
"popularized it among Perl programmers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now that Python sorting provides key-functions, this technique is not often "
"needed."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Old Way Using the *cmp* Parameter"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many constructs given in this HOWTO assume Python 2.4 or later. Before that, "
"there was no :func:`sorted` builtin and :meth:`list.sort` took no keyword "
"arguments. Instead, all of the Py2.x versions supported a *cmp* parameter to "
"handle user specified comparison functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Py3.0, the *cmp* parameter was removed entirely (as part of a larger "
"effort to simplify and unify the language, eliminating the conflict between "
"rich comparisons and the :meth:`__cmp__` magic method)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Py2.x, sort allowed an optional function which can be called for doing "
"the comparisons. That function should take two arguments to be compared and "
"then return a negative value for less-than, return zero if they are equal, "
"or return a positive value for greater-than. For example, we can do:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Or you can reverse the order of comparison with:"
msgstr "Lub możesz odwrócić kolejność porównania za pomocą:"

msgid ""
"When porting code from Python 2.x to 3.x, the situation can arise when you "
"have the user supplying a comparison function and you need to convert that "
"to a key function. The following wrapper makes that easy to do:"
msgstr ""

msgid "To convert to a key function, just wrap the old comparison function:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Python 3.2, the :func:`functools.cmp_to_key` function was added to the :"
"mod:`functools` module in the standard library."
msgstr ""

msgid "Odd and Ends"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For locale aware sorting, use :func:`locale.strxfrm` for a key function or :"
"func:`locale.strcoll` for a comparison function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *reverse* parameter still maintains sort stability (so that records with "
"equal keys retain the original order). Interestingly, that effect can be "
"simulated without the parameter by using the builtin :func:`reversed` "
"function twice:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The sort routines use ``<`` when making comparisons between two objects. So, "
"it is easy to add a standard sort order to a class by defining an :meth:"
"`__lt__` method:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, note that ``<`` can fall back to using :meth:`__gt__` if :meth:"
"`__lt__` is not implemented (see :func:`object.__lt__`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Key functions need not depend directly on the objects being sorted. A key "
"function can also access external resources. For instance, if the student "
"grades are stored in a dictionary, they can be used to sort a separate list "
"of student names:"
msgstr ""
