msgid ""
"This is the same as the Python-level :meth:`dict.setdefault`.  If present, "

"`PyObject*` variables that will be filled in with each key and value, "
"respectively, or may be ``NULL``.  Any references returned through them are "
"borrowed.  *ppos* should not be altered during iteration. Its value "
