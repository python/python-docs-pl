"the Python layer."

"Return true if *ob* is a slice object; *ob* must not be ``NULL``.  This "
"function always succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a new slice object with the given values.  The *start*, *stop*, and "
"*step* parameters are used as the values of the slice object attributes of "
"the same names.  Any of the values may be ``NULL``, in which case the "
"``None`` will be used for the corresponding attribute.  Return ``NULL`` if "
"the new object could not be allocated."

msgid ""
"Retrieve the start, stop and step indices from the slice object *slice*, "
"assuming a sequence of length *length*. Treats indices greater than *length* "
"as errors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns ``0`` on success and ``-1`` on error with no exception set (unless "
"one of the indices was not :const:`None` and failed to be converted to an "
"integer, in which case ``-1`` is returned with an exception set)."

msgid ""
"The parameter type for the *slice* parameter was ``PySliceObject*`` before."

msgid ""
"Usable replacement for :c:func:`PySlice_GetIndices`.  Retrieve the start, "
"stop, and step indices from the slice object *slice* assuming a sequence of "
"length *length*, and store the length of the slice in *slicelength*.  Out of "
"bounds indices are clipped in a manner consistent with the handling of "
"normal slices."

msgid "Ellipsis Object"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
