"\"Cell\" objects are used to implement variables referenced by multiple "
"scopes. For each such variable, a cell object is created to store the value; "
"the local variables of each stack frame that references the value contains a "
"reference to the cells from outer scopes which also use that variable.  When "
"the value is accessed, the value contained in the cell is used instead of "
"the cell object itself.  This de-referencing of the cell object requires "
"support from the generated byte-code; these are not automatically de-"
"referenced when accessed. Cell objects are not likely to be useful elsewhere."
