"The functions and macros in this section are used for managing reference "
"counts of Python objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "Get the reference count of the Python object *o*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the :c:func:`Py_SET_REFCNT()` function to set an object reference count."
msgstr ""

msgid "The parameter type is no longer :c:expr:`const PyObject*`."
msgstr ""

msgid ":c:func:`Py_REFCNT()` is changed to the inline static function."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set the object *o* reference counter to *refcnt*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Increment the reference count for object *o*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is usually used to convert a :term:`borrowed reference` to a :"
"term:`strong reference` in-place. The :c:func:`Py_NewRef` function can be "
"used to create a new :term:`strong reference`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The object must not be ``NULL``; if you aren't sure that it isn't ``NULL``, "
"use :c:func:`Py_XINCREF`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Increment the reference count for object *o*.  The object may be ``NULL``, "
"in which case the macro has no effect."
msgstr ""

msgid "See also :c:func:`Py_XNewRef`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new :term:`strong reference` to an object: increment the reference "
"count of the object *o* and return the object *o*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the :term:`strong reference` is no longer needed, :c:func:`Py_DECREF` "
"should be called on it to decrement the object reference count."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The object *o* must not be ``NULL``; use :c:func:`Py_XNewRef` if *o* can be "
"``NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example::"
msgstr "Dla przykładu::"

msgid "can be written as::"
msgstr ""

msgid "See also :c:func:`Py_INCREF`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Similar to :c:func:`Py_NewRef`, but the object *o* can be NULL."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the object *o* is ``NULL``, the function just returns ``NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Decrement the reference count for object *o*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the reference count reaches zero, the object's type's deallocation "
"function (which must not be ``NULL``) is invoked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is usually used to delete a :term:`strong reference` before "
"exiting its scope."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The object must not be ``NULL``; if you aren't sure that it isn't ``NULL``, "
"use :c:func:`Py_XDECREF`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The deallocation function can cause arbitrary Python code to be invoked (e."
"g. when a class instance with a :meth:`__del__` method is deallocated).  "
"While exceptions in such code are not propagated, the executed code has free "
"access to all Python global variables.  This means that any object that is "
"reachable from a global variable should be in a consistent state before :c:"
"func:`Py_DECREF` is invoked.  For example, code to delete an object from a "
"list should copy a reference to the deleted object in a temporary variable, "
"update the list data structure, and then call :c:func:`Py_DECREF` for the "
"temporary variable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Decrement the reference count for object *o*.  The object may be ``NULL``, "
"in which case the macro has no effect; otherwise the effect is the same as "
"for :c:func:`Py_DECREF`, and the same warning applies."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Decrement the reference count for object *o*.  The object may be ``NULL``, "
"in which case the macro has no effect; otherwise the effect is the same as "
"for :c:func:`Py_DECREF`, except that the argument is also set to ``NULL``.  "
"The warning for :c:func:`Py_DECREF` does not apply with respect to the "
"object passed because the macro carefully uses a temporary variable and sets "
"the argument to ``NULL`` before decrementing its reference count."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is a good idea to use this macro whenever decrementing the reference "
"count of an object that might be traversed during garbage collection."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The macro argument is now only evaluated once. If the argument has side "
"effects, these are no longer duplicated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Increment the reference count for object *o*. A function version of :c:func:"
"`Py_XINCREF`. It can be used for runtime dynamic embedding of Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Decrement the reference count for object *o*. A function version of :c:func:"
"`Py_XDECREF`. It can be used for runtime dynamic embedding of Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Macro safely decrementing the `dst` reference count and setting `dst` to "
"`src`."
msgstr ""

msgid "As in case of :c:func:`Py_CLEAR`, \"the obvious\" code can be deadly::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The safe way is::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That arranges to set `dst` to `src` _before_ decrementing reference count of "
"*dst* old value, so that any code triggered as a side-effect of `dst` "
"getting torn down no longer believes `dst` points to a valid object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The macro arguments are now only evaluated once. If an argument has side "
"effects, these are no longer duplicated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Variant of :c:macro:`Py_SETREF` macro that uses :c:func:`Py_XDECREF` instead "
"of :c:func:`Py_DECREF`."
