"This function is usually used to convert a :term:`borrowed reference` to a :"
"term:`strong reference` in-place. The :c:func:`Py_NewRef` function can be "
"used to create a new :term:`strong reference`."
msgstr ""

msgid "When done using the object, release it by calling :c:func:`Py_DECREF`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The object must not be ``NULL``; if you aren't sure that it isn't ``NULL``, "
"use :c:func:`Py_XINCREF`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Do not expect this function to actually modify *o* in any way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :c:func:`Py_INCREF`, but the object *o* can be ``NULL``, in which "

"Create a new :term:`strong reference` to an object: call :c:func:`Py_INCREF` "

"When the :term:`strong reference` is no longer needed, :c:func:`Py_DECREF` "
"should be called on it to release the reference."

"Once the last :term:`strong reference` is released (i.e. the object's "
"reference count reaches 0), the object's type's deallocation function (which "
"must not be ``NULL``) is invoked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is usually used to delete a :term:`strong reference` before "
"exiting its scope."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The object must not be ``NULL``; if you aren't sure that it isn't ``NULL``, "
"use :c:func:`Py_XDECREF`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The deallocation function can cause arbitrary Python code to be invoked (e."
"g. when a class instance with a :meth:`__del__` method is deallocated).  "
"While exceptions in such code are not propagated, the executed code has free "
"access to all Python global variables.  This means that any object that is "
"reachable from a global variable should be in a consistent state before :c:"
"func:`Py_DECREF` is invoked.  For example, code to delete an object from a "
"list should copy a reference to the deleted object in a temporary variable, "
"update the list data structure, and then call :c:func:`Py_DECREF` for the "
"temporary variable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :c:func:`Py_DECREF`, but the object *o* can be ``NULL``, in which "
"case this has no effect. The same warning from :c:func:`Py_DECREF` applies "
"here as well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Release a :term:`strong reference` for object *o*. The object may be "
"``NULL``, in which case the macro has no effect; otherwise the effect is the "
"same as for :c:func:`Py_DECREF`, except that the argument is also set to "
"``NULL``.  The warning for :c:func:`Py_DECREF` does not apply with respect "
"to the object passed because the macro carefully uses a temporary variable "
"and sets the argument to ``NULL`` before releasing the reference."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is a good idea to use this macro whenever releasing a reference to an "
"object that might be traversed during garbage collection."
