"This function is usually used to convert a :term:`borrowed reference` to a :"
"term:`strong reference` in-place. The :c:func:`Py_NewRef` function can be "
"used to create a new :term:`strong reference`."

msgid ""
"The object must not be ``NULL``; if you aren't sure that it isn't ``NULL``, "

"Increment the reference count for object *o*.  The object may be ``NULL``, "
"in which case the macro has no effect."

"Create a new :term:`strong reference` to an object: increment the reference "
"count of the object *o* and return the object *o*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the :term:`strong reference` is no longer needed, :c:func:`Py_DECREF` "
"should be called on it to decrement the object reference count."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The object *o* must not be ``NULL``; use :c:func:`Py_XNewRef` if *o* can be "
"``NULL``."

msgid "For example::"

msgid "can be written as::"

msgid "See also :c:func:`Py_INCREF`."

msgid "If the object *o* is ``NULL``, the function just returns ``NULL``."

msgid "Decrement the reference count for object *o*."

msgid ""
"If the reference count reaches zero, the object's type's deallocation "
"function (which must not be ``NULL``) is invoked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is usually used to delete a :term:`strong reference` before "
"exiting its scope."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The object must not be ``NULL``; if you aren't sure that it isn't ``NULL``, "
"use :c:func:`Py_XDECREF`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The deallocation function can cause arbitrary Python code to be invoked (e."
"g. when a class instance with a :meth:`__del__` method is deallocated).  "
"While exceptions in such code are not propagated, the executed code has free "
"access to all Python global variables.  This means that any object that is "
"reachable from a global variable should be in a consistent state before :c:"
"func:`Py_DECREF` is invoked.  For example, code to delete an object from a "
"list should copy a reference to the deleted object in a temporary variable, "
"update the list data structure, and then call :c:func:`Py_DECREF` for the "
"temporary variable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Decrement the reference count for object *o*.  The object may be ``NULL``, "
"in which case the macro has no effect; otherwise the effect is the same as "
"for :c:func:`Py_DECREF`, and the same warning applies."

msgid ""
"Decrement the reference count for object *o*.  The object may be ``NULL``, "
"in which case the macro has no effect; otherwise the effect is the same as "
"for :c:func:`Py_DECREF`, except that the argument is also set to ``NULL``.  "
"The warning for :c:func:`Py_DECREF` does not apply with respect to the "
"object passed because the macro carefully uses a temporary variable and sets "
"the argument to ``NULL`` before decrementing its reference count."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is a good idea to use this macro whenever decrementing the reference "
"count of an object that might be traversed during garbage collection."
