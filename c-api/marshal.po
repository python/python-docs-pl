"These routines allow C code to work with serialized objects using the same "
"data format as the :mod:`marshal` module.  There are functions to write data "
"into the serialization format, and additional functions that can be used to "
"read the data back.  Files used to store marshalled data must be opened in "
"binary mode."

msgid "Numeric values are stored with the least significant byte first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module supports two versions of the data format: version 0 is the "
"historical version, version 1 shares interned strings in the file, and upon "
"unmarshalling.  Version 2 uses a binary format for floating point numbers. "
"``Py_MARSHAL_VERSION`` indicates the current file format (currently 2)."

"Marshal a :c:expr:`long` integer, *value*, to *file*.  This will only write "
"the least-significant 32 bits of *value*; regardless of the size of the "

"Return a C :c:expr:`long` from the data stream in a :c:expr:`FILE*` opened "

"Return a Python object from the data stream in a :c:expr:`FILE*` opened for "
"reading.  Unlike :c:func:`PyMarshal_ReadObjectFromFile`, this function "
"assumes that no further objects will be read from the file, allowing it to "
"aggressively load file data into memory so that the de-serialization can "
"operate from data in memory rather than reading a byte at a time from the "
"file.  Only use these variant if you are certain that you won't be reading "
"anything else from the file."
