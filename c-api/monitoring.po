"An extension may need to interact with the event monitoring system. "
"Subscribing to events and registering callbacks can be done via the Python "
"API exposed in :mod:`sys.monitoring`."

msgid "Generating Execution Events"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The functions below make it possible for an extension to fire monitoring "
"events as it emulates the execution of Python code. Each of these functions "
"accepts a ``PyMonitoringState`` struct which contains concise information "
"about the activation state of events, as well as the event arguments, which "
"include a ``PyObject*`` representing the code object, the instruction offset "
"and sometimes additional, event-specific arguments (see :mod:`sys."
"monitoring` for details about the signatures of the different event "
"callbacks). The ``codelike`` argument should be an instance of :class:`types."
"CodeType` or of a type that emulates it."

"The VM disables tracing when firing an event, so there is no need for user "

msgid "Managing the Monitoring State"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Monitoring states can be managed with the help of monitoring scopes. A scope "
"would typically correspond to a python function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enter a monitored scope. ``event_types`` is an array of the event IDs for "
"events that may be fired from the scope. For example, the ID of a "
"``PY_START`` event is the value ``PY_MONITORING_EVENT_PY_START``, which is "
"numerically equal to the base-2 logarithm of ``sys.monitoring.events."
"PY_START``. ``state_array`` is an array with a monitoring state entry for "
"each event in ``event_types``, it is allocated by the user but populated by :"
"c:func:`!PyMonitoring_EnterScope` with information about the activation "
"state of the event. The size of ``event_types`` (and hence also of "
"``state_array``) is given in ``length``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``version`` argument is a pointer to a value which should be allocated "
"by the user together with ``state_array`` and initialized to 0, and then set "
"only by :c:func:`!PyMonitoring_EnterScope` itelf. It allows this function to "
"determine whether event states have changed since the previous call, and to "
"return quickly if they have not."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The scopes referred to here are lexical scopes: a function, class or "
"method. :c:func:`!PyMonitoring_EnterScope` should be called whenever the "
"lexical scope is entered. Scopes can be reentered, reusing the same "
"*state_array* and *version*, in situations like when emulating a recursive "
"Python function. When a code-like's execution is paused, such as when "
"emulating a generator, the scope needs to be exited and re-entered."
