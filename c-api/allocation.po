"Initialize a newly allocated object *op* with its type and initial "
"reference.  Returns the initialized object.  If *type* indicates that the "
"object participates in the cyclic garbage detector, it is added to the "
"detector's set of observed objects. Other fields of the object are not "
"affected."

"This does everything :c:func:`PyObject_Init` does, and also initializes the "

"Allocate a new Python object using the C structure type *TYPE* and the "
"Python type object *type*.  Fields not defined by the Python object header "
"are not initialized; the object's reference count will be one.  The size of "

"Allocate a new Python object using the C structure type *TYPE* and the "
"Python type object *type*.  Fields not defined by the Python object header "
"are not initialized.  The allocated memory allows for the *TYPE* structure "
"plus *size* fields of the size given by the :c:member:`~PyTypeObject."
"tp_itemsize` field of *type*.  This is useful for implementing objects like "
"tuples, which are able to determine their size at construction time.  "
"Embedding the array of fields into the same allocation decreases the number "
"of allocations, improving the memory management efficiency."

"fields of the object should not be accessed after this call as the memory is "
"no longer a valid Python object."
