"This subtype of :c:type:`PyObject` represents an opaque value, useful for C "
"extension modules who need to pass an opaque value (as a :c:expr:`void*` "
"pointer) through Python code to other C code.  It is often used to make a C "
"function pointer defined in one module available to other modules, so the "
"regular import mechanism can be used to access C APIs defined in dynamically "
"loaded modules."
