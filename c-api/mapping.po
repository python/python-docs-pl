"Return ``1`` if the object provides the mapping protocol or supports "
"slicing, and ``0`` otherwise.  Note that it returns ``1`` for Python classes "
"with a :meth:`~object.__getitem__` method, since in general it is impossible "
"to determine what type of keys the class supports. This function always "
"succeeds."

"Returns the number of keys in object *o* on success, and ``-1`` on failure. "
"This is equivalent to the Python expression ``len(o)``."

"Variant of :c:func:`PyObject_GetItem` which doesn't raise :exc:`KeyError` if "

"*\\*result* to ``NULL``."
