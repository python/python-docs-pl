"Return ``1`` if the object provides the mapping protocol or supports "
"slicing, and ``0`` otherwise.  Note that it returns ``1`` for Python classes "
"with a :meth:`__getitem__` method, since in general it is impossible to "
"determine what type of keys the class supports. This function always "
"succeeds."

msgid ""
"Returns the number of keys in object *o* on success, and ``-1`` on failure. "
"This is equivalent to the Python expression ``len(o)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return element of *o* corresponding to the string *key* or ``NULL`` on "
"failure. This is the equivalent of the Python expression ``o[key]``. See "
"also :c:func:`PyObject_GetItem`."

msgid ""
"Map the string *key* to the value *v* in object *o*.  Returns ``-1`` on "
"failure.  This is the equivalent of the Python statement ``o[key] = v``. See "
"also :c:func:`PyObject_SetItem`.  This function *does not* steal a reference "
"to *v*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Remove the mapping for the object *key* from the object *o*.  Return ``-1`` "
"on failure.  This is equivalent to the Python statement ``del o[key]``. This "
