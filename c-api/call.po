msgid "Call Protocol"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"CPython supports two different calling protocols: *tp_call* and vectorcall."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *tp_call* Protocol"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instances of classes that set :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_call` are "
"callable. The signature of the slot is::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A call is made using a tuple for the positional arguments and a dict for the "
"keyword arguments, similarly to ``callable(*args, **kwargs)`` in Python "
"code. *args* must be non-NULL (use an empty tuple if there are no arguments) "
"but *kwargs* may be *NULL* if there are no keyword arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This convention is not only used by *tp_call*: :c:member:`~PyTypeObject."
"tp_new` and :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_init` also pass arguments this way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To call an object, use :c:func:`PyObject_Call` or another :ref:`call API "
"<capi-call>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Vectorcall Protocol"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The vectorcall protocol was introduced in :pep:`590` as an additional "
"protocol for making calls more efficient."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As rule of thumb, CPython will prefer the vectorcall for internal calls if "
"the callable supports it. However, this is not a hard rule. Additionally, "
"some third-party extensions use *tp_call* directly (rather than using :c:"
"func:`PyObject_Call`). Therefore, a class supporting vectorcall must also "
"implement :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_call`. Moreover, the callable must "
"behave the same regardless of which protocol is used. The recommended way to "
"achieve this is by setting :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_call` to :c:func:"
"`PyVectorcall_Call`. This bears repeating:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A class supporting vectorcall **must** also implement :c:member:"
"`~PyTypeObject.tp_call` with the same semantics."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :const:`Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL` flag is now removed from a class "
"when the class's :py:meth:`~object.__call__` method is reassigned. (This "
"internally sets :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_call` only, and thus may make it "
"behave differently than the vectorcall function.) In earlier Python "
"versions, vectorcall should only be used with :const:`immutable "
"<Py_TPFLAGS_IMMUTABLETYPE>` or static types."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A class should not implement vectorcall if that would be slower than "
"*tp_call*. For example, if the callee needs to convert the arguments to an "
"args tuple and kwargs dict anyway, then there is no point in implementing "
"vectorcall."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Classes can implement the vectorcall protocol by enabling the :const:"
"`Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL` flag and setting :c:member:`~PyTypeObject."
"tp_vectorcall_offset` to the offset inside the object structure where a "
"*vectorcallfunc* appears. This is a pointer to a function with the following "
"signature:"
msgstr ""

msgid "*callable* is the object being called."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*args* is a C array consisting of the positional arguments followed by the"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"values of the keyword arguments. This can be *NULL* if there are no "
"arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid "*nargsf* is the number of positional arguments plus possibly the"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":const:`PY_VECTORCALL_ARGUMENTS_OFFSET` flag. To get the actual number of "
"positional arguments from *nargsf*, use :c:func:`PyVectorcall_NARGS`."
msgstr ""

msgid "*kwnames* is a tuple containing the names of the keyword arguments;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"in other words, the keys of the kwargs dict. These names must be strings "
"(instances of ``str`` or a subclass) and they must be unique. If there are "
"no keyword arguments, then *kwnames* can instead be *NULL*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this flag is set in a vectorcall *nargsf* argument, the callee is allowed "
"to temporarily change ``args[-1]``. In other words, *args* points to "
"argument 1 (not 0) in the allocated vector. The callee must restore the "
"value of ``args[-1]`` before returning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For :c:func:`PyObject_VectorcallMethod`, this flag means instead that "
"``args[0]`` may be changed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whenever they can do so cheaply (without additional allocation), callers are "
"encouraged to use :const:`PY_VECTORCALL_ARGUMENTS_OFFSET`. Doing so will "
"allow callables such as bound methods to make their onward calls (which "
"include a prepended *self* argument) very efficiently."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To call an object that implements vectorcall, use a :ref:`call API <capi-"
"call>` function as with any other callable. :c:func:`PyObject_Vectorcall` "
"will usually be most efficient."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In CPython 3.8, the vectorcall API and related functions were available "
"provisionally under names with a leading underscore: "
"``_PyObject_Vectorcall``, ``_Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL``, "
"``_PyObject_VectorcallMethod``, ``_PyVectorcall_Function``, "
"``_PyObject_CallOneArg``, ``_PyObject_CallMethodNoArgs``, "
"``_PyObject_CallMethodOneArg``. Additionally, ``PyObject_VectorcallDict`` "
"was available as ``_PyObject_FastCallDict``. The old names are still defined "
"as aliases of the new, non-underscored names."
msgstr ""

msgid "Recursion Control"
msgstr "Kontrola Rekursji"

msgid ""
"When using *tp_call*, callees do not need to worry about :ref:`recursion "
"<recursion>`: CPython uses :c:func:`Py_EnterRecursiveCall` and :c:func:"
"`Py_LeaveRecursiveCall` for calls made using *tp_call*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For efficiency, this is not the case for calls done using vectorcall: the "
"callee should use *Py_EnterRecursiveCall* and *Py_LeaveRecursiveCall* if "
"needed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Vectorcall Support API"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Given a vectorcall *nargsf* argument, return the actual number of arguments. "
"Currently equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, the function ``PyVectorcall_NARGS`` should be used to allow for "
"future extensions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *op* does not support the vectorcall protocol (either because the type "
"does not or because the specific instance does not), return *NULL*. "
"Otherwise, return the vectorcall function pointer stored in *op*. This "
"function never raises an exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is mostly useful to check whether or not *op* supports vectorcall, "
"which can be done by checking ``PyVectorcall_Function(op) != NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Call *callable*'s :c:type:`vectorcallfunc` with positional and keyword "
"arguments given in a tuple and dict, respectively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a specialized function, intended to be put in the :c:member:"
"`~PyTypeObject.tp_call` slot or be used in an implementation of ``tp_call``. "
"It does not check the :const:`Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL` flag and it does "
"not fall back to ``tp_call``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Object Calling API"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Various functions are available for calling a Python object. Each converts "
"its arguments to a convention supported by the called object – either "
"*tp_call* or vectorcall. In order to do as little conversion as possible, "
"pick one that best fits the format of data you have available."
