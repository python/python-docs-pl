msgid "Sequence Protocol"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``1`` if the object provides the sequence protocol, and ``0`` "
"otherwise. Note that it returns ``1`` for Python classes with a :meth:"
"`__getitem__` method, unless they are :class:`dict` subclasses, since in "
"general it is impossible to determine what type of keys the class supports.  "
"This function always succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns the number of objects in sequence *o* on success, and ``-1`` on "
"failure.  This is equivalent to the Python expression ``len(o)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the concatenation of *o1* and *o2* on success, and ``NULL`` on "
"failure. This is the equivalent of the Python expression ``o1 + o2``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the result of repeating sequence object *o* *count* times, or "
"``NULL`` on failure.  This is the equivalent of the Python expression ``o * "
"count``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the concatenation of *o1* and *o2* on success, and ``NULL`` on "
"failure. The operation is done *in-place* when *o1* supports it.  This is "
"the equivalent of the Python expression ``o1 += o2``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the result of repeating sequence object *o* *count* times, or "
"``NULL`` on failure.  The operation is done *in-place* when *o* supports "
"it.  This is the equivalent of the Python expression ``o *= count``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the *i*\\ th element of *o*, or ``NULL`` on failure. This is the "
"equivalent of the Python expression ``o[i]``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the slice of sequence object *o* between *i1* and *i2*, or ``NULL`` "
"on failure. This is the equivalent of the Python expression ``o[i1:i2]``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assign object *v* to the *i*\\ th element of *o*.  Raise an exception and "
"return ``-1`` on failure; return ``0`` on success.  This is the equivalent "
"of the Python statement ``o[i] = v``.  This function *does not* steal a "
"reference to *v*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *v* is ``NULL``, the element is deleted, but this feature is deprecated "
"in favour of using :c:func:`PySequence_DelItem`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Delete the *i*\\ th element of object *o*.  Returns ``-1`` on failure.  This "
"is the equivalent of the Python statement ``del o[i]``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assign the sequence object *v* to the slice in sequence object *o* from *i1* "
"to *i2*.  This is the equivalent of the Python statement ``o[i1:i2] = v``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Delete the slice in sequence object *o* from *i1* to *i2*.  Returns ``-1`` "
"on failure.  This is the equivalent of the Python statement ``del o[i1:i2]``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the number of occurrences of *value* in *o*, that is, return the "
"number of keys for which ``o[key] == value``.  On failure, return ``-1``.  "
"This is equivalent to the Python expression ``o.count(value)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Determine if *o* contains *value*.  If an item in *o* is equal to *value*, "
"return ``1``, otherwise return ``0``. On error, return ``-1``.  This is "
"equivalent to the Python expression ``value in o``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the first index *i* for which ``o[i] == value``.  On error, return "
"``-1``.    This is equivalent to the Python expression ``o.index(value)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a list object with the same contents as the sequence or iterable *o*, "
"or ``NULL`` on failure.  The returned list is guaranteed to be new.  This is "
"equivalent to the Python expression ``list(o)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a tuple object with the same contents as the sequence or iterable "
"*o*, or ``NULL`` on failure.  If *o* is a tuple, a new reference will be "
"returned, otherwise a tuple will be constructed with the appropriate "
"contents.  This is equivalent to the Python expression ``tuple(o)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the sequence or iterable *o* as an object usable by the other "
"``PySequence_Fast*`` family of functions. If the object is not a sequence or "
"iterable, raises :exc:`TypeError` with *m* as the message text. Returns "
"``NULL`` on failure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``PySequence_Fast*`` functions are thus named because they assume *o* is "
"a :c:type:`PyTupleObject` or a :c:type:`PyListObject` and access the data "
"fields of *o* directly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a CPython implementation detail, if *o* is already a sequence or list, it "
"will be returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns the length of *o*, assuming that *o* was returned by :c:func:"
"`PySequence_Fast` and that *o* is not ``NULL``.  The size can also be "
"retrieved by calling :c:func:`PySequence_Size` on *o*, but :c:func:"
"`PySequence_Fast_GET_SIZE` is faster because it can assume *o* is a list or "
"tuple."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the *i*\\ th element of *o*, assuming that *o* was returned by :c:"
"func:`PySequence_Fast`, *o* is not ``NULL``, and that *i* is within bounds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the underlying array of PyObject pointers.  Assumes that *o* was "
"returned by :c:func:`PySequence_Fast` and *o* is not ``NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note, if a list gets resized, the reallocation may relocate the items array. "
"So, only use the underlying array pointer in contexts where the sequence "
"cannot change."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the *i*\\ th element of *o* or ``NULL`` on failure. Faster form of :c:"
"func:`PySequence_GetItem` but without checking that :c:func:"
