msgid "This subtype of :c:type:`PyObject` represents a Python list object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This instance of :c:type:`PyTypeObject` represents the Python list type. "
"This is the same object as :class:`list` in the Python layer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return true if *p* is a list object or an instance of a subtype of the list "
"type.  This function always succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return true if *p* is a list object, but not an instance of a subtype of the "
"list type.  This function always succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return a new list of length *len* on success, or ``NULL`` on failure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *len* is greater than zero, the returned list object's items are set to "
"``NULL``.  Thus you cannot use abstract API functions such as :c:func:"
"`PySequence_SetItem`  or expose the object to Python code before setting all "
"items to a real object with :c:func:`PyList_SetItem`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the length of the list object in *list*; this is equivalent to "
"``len(list)`` on a list object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Similar to :c:func:`PyList_Size`, but without error checking."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the object at position *index* in the list pointed to by *list*.  The "
"position must be non-negative; indexing from the end of the list is not "
"supported.  If *index* is out of bounds (<0 or >=len(list)), return ``NULL`` "
"and set an :exc:`IndexError` exception."
msgstr ""

msgid "Similar to :c:func:`PyList_GetItem`, but without error checking."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the item at index *index* in list to *item*.  Return ``0`` on success. "
"If *index* is out of bounds, return ``-1`` and set an :exc:`IndexError` "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function \"steals\" a reference to *item* and discards a reference to "
"an item already in the list at the affected position."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Macro form of :c:func:`PyList_SetItem` without error checking. This is "
"normally only used to fill in new lists where there is no previous content."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This macro \"steals\" a reference to *item*, and, unlike :c:func:"
"`PyList_SetItem`, does *not* discard a reference to any item that is being "
"replaced; any reference in *list* at position *i* will be leaked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Insert the item *item* into list *list* in front of index *index*.  Return "
"``0`` if successful; return ``-1`` and set an exception if unsuccessful. "
"Analogous to ``list.insert(index, item)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Append the object *item* at the end of list *list*. Return ``0`` if "
"successful; return ``-1`` and set an exception if unsuccessful.  Analogous "
"to ``list.append(item)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a list of the objects in *list* containing the objects *between* "
"*low* and *high*.  Return ``NULL`` and set an exception if unsuccessful.  "
"Analogous to ``list[low:high]``.  Indexing from the end of the list is not "
"supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the slice of *list* between *low* and *high* to the contents of "
"*itemlist*.  Analogous to ``list[low:high] = itemlist``. The *itemlist* may "
"be ``NULL``, indicating the assignment of an empty list (slice deletion). "

"list is not supported."

msgid ""
"Sort the items of *list* in place.  Return ``0`` on success, ``-1`` on "
