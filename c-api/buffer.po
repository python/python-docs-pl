msgid "Buffer Protocol"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Certain objects available in Python wrap access to an underlying memory "
"array or *buffer*.  Such objects include the built-in :class:`bytes` and :"
"class:`bytearray`, and some extension types like :class:`array.array`. Third-"
"party libraries may define their own types for special purposes, such as "
"image processing or numeric analysis."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While each of these types have their own semantics, they share the common "
"characteristic of being backed by a possibly large memory buffer.  It is "
"then desirable, in some situations, to access that buffer directly and "
"without intermediate copying."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python provides such a facility at the C level in the form of the :ref:"
"`buffer protocol <bufferobjects>`.  This protocol has two sides:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"on the producer side, a type can export a \"buffer interface\" which allows "
"objects of that type to expose information about their underlying buffer. "
"This interface is described in the section :ref:`buffer-structs`;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"on the consumer side, several means are available to obtain a pointer to the "
"raw underlying data of an object (for example a method parameter)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Simple objects such as :class:`bytes` and :class:`bytearray` expose their "
"underlying buffer in byte-oriented form.  Other forms are possible; for "
"example, the elements exposed by an :class:`array.array` can be multi-byte "
"values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An example consumer of the buffer interface is the :meth:`~io.BufferedIOBase."
"write` method of file objects: any object that can export a series of bytes "
"through the buffer interface can be written to a file.  While :meth:`write` "
"only needs read-only access to the internal contents of the object passed to "
"it, other methods such as :meth:`~io.BufferedIOBase.readinto` need write "
"access to the contents of their argument.  The buffer interface allows "
"objects to selectively allow or reject exporting of read-write and read-only "
"buffers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are two ways for a consumer of the buffer interface to acquire a "
"buffer over a target object:"
msgstr ""

msgid "call :c:func:`PyObject_GetBuffer` with the right parameters;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"call :c:func:`PyArg_ParseTuple` (or one of its siblings) with one of the "
"``y*``, ``w*`` or ``s*`` :ref:`format codes <arg-parsing>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In both cases, :c:func:`PyBuffer_Release` must be called when the buffer "
"isn't needed anymore.  Failure to do so could lead to various issues such as "
"resource leaks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Buffer structure"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Buffer structures (or simply \"buffers\") are useful as a way to expose the "
"binary data from another object to the Python programmer.  They can also be "
"used as a zero-copy slicing mechanism.  Using their ability to reference a "
"block of memory, it is possible to expose any data to the Python programmer "
"quite easily.  The memory could be a large, constant array in a C extension, "
"it could be a raw block of memory for manipulation before passing to an "
"operating system library, or it could be used to pass around structured data "
"in its native, in-memory format."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Contrary to most data types exposed by the Python interpreter, buffers are "
"not :c:type:`PyObject` pointers but rather simple C structures.  This allows "
"them to be created and copied very simply.  When a generic wrapper around a "
"buffer is needed, a :ref:`memoryview <memoryview-objects>` object can be "
"created."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For short instructions how to write an exporting object, see :ref:`Buffer "
"Object Structures <buffer-structs>`. For obtaining a buffer, see :c:func:"
"`PyObject_GetBuffer`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A pointer to the start of the logical structure described by the buffer "
"fields. This can be any location within the underlying physical memory block "
"of the exporter. For example, with negative :c:member:`~Py_buffer.strides` "
"the value may point to the end of the memory block."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For :term:`contiguous` arrays, the value points to the beginning of the "
"memory block."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A new reference to the exporting object. The reference is owned by the "
"consumer and automatically decremented and set to ``NULL`` by :c:func:"
"`PyBuffer_Release`. The field is the equivalent of the return value of any "
"standard C-API function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a special case, for *temporary* buffers that are wrapped by :c:func:"
"`PyMemoryView_FromBuffer` or :c:func:`PyBuffer_FillInfo` this field is "
"``NULL``. In general, exporting objects MUST NOT use this scheme."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``product(shape) * itemsize``. For contiguous arrays, this is the length of "
"the underlying memory block. For non-contiguous arrays, it is the length "
"that the logical structure would have if it were copied to a contiguous "
"representation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Accessing ``((char *)buf)[0] up to ((char *)buf)[len-1]`` is only valid if "
"the buffer has been obtained by a request that guarantees contiguity. In "
"most cases such a request will be :c:macro:`PyBUF_SIMPLE` or :c:macro:"
"`PyBUF_WRITABLE`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An indicator of whether the buffer is read-only. This field is controlled by "
"the :c:macro:`PyBUF_WRITABLE` flag."
msgstr ""

"Item size in bytes of a single element. Same as the value of :func:`struct."
"calcsize` called on non-``NULL`` :c:member:`~Py_buffer.format` values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Important exception: If a consumer requests a buffer without the :c:macro:"
"`PyBUF_FORMAT` flag, :c:member:`~Py_buffer.format` will be set to  "
"``NULL``,  but :c:member:`~Py_buffer.itemsize` still has the value for the "
"original format."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If :c:member:`~Py_buffer.shape` is present, the equality ``product(shape) * "
"itemsize == len`` still holds and the consumer can use :c:member:`~Py_buffer."
"itemsize` to navigate the buffer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If :c:member:`~Py_buffer.shape` is ``NULL`` as a result of a :c:macro:"
"`PyBUF_SIMPLE` or a :c:macro:`PyBUF_WRITABLE` request, the consumer must "
"disregard :c:member:`~Py_buffer.itemsize` and assume ``itemsize == 1``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A *NUL* terminated string in :mod:`struct` module style syntax describing "
"the contents of a single item. If this is ``NULL``, ``\"B\"`` (unsigned "
"bytes) is assumed."
msgstr ""

msgid "This field is controlled by the :c:macro:`PyBUF_FORMAT` flag."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The number of dimensions the memory represents as an n-dimensional array. If "
"it is ``0``, :c:member:`~Py_buffer.buf` points to a single item representing "
"a scalar. In this case, :c:member:`~Py_buffer.shape`, :c:member:`~Py_buffer."
"strides` and :c:member:`~Py_buffer.suboffsets` MUST be ``NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The macro :c:macro:`PyBUF_MAX_NDIM` limits the maximum number of dimensions "
"to 64. Exporters MUST respect this limit, consumers of multi-dimensional "
"buffers SHOULD be able to handle up to :c:macro:`PyBUF_MAX_NDIM` dimensions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An array of :c:type:`Py_ssize_t` of length :c:member:`~Py_buffer.ndim` "
"indicating the shape of the memory as an n-dimensional array. Note that "
"``shape[0] * ... * shape[ndim-1] * itemsize`` MUST be equal to :c:member:"
"`~Py_buffer.len`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Shape values are restricted to ``shape[n] >= 0``. The case ``shape[n] == 0`` "
"requires special attention. See `complex arrays`_ for further information."
msgstr ""

msgid "The shape array is read-only for the consumer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An array of :c:type:`Py_ssize_t` of length :c:member:`~Py_buffer.ndim` "
"giving the number of bytes to skip to get to a new element in each dimension."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Stride values can be any integer. For regular arrays, strides are usually "
"positive, but a consumer MUST be able to handle the case ``strides[n] <= "
"0``. See `complex arrays`_ for further information."
msgstr ""

msgid "The strides array is read-only for the consumer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An array of :c:type:`Py_ssize_t` of length :c:member:`~Py_buffer.ndim`. If "
"``suboffsets[n] >= 0``, the values stored along the nth dimension are "
"pointers and the suboffset value dictates how many bytes to add to each "
"pointer after de-referencing. A suboffset value that is negative indicates "
"that no de-referencing should occur (striding in a contiguous memory block)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If all suboffsets are negative (i.e. no de-referencing is needed), then this "
"field must be ``NULL`` (the default value)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This type of array representation is used by the Python Imaging Library "
"(PIL). See `complex arrays`_ for further information how to access elements "
"of such an array."
msgstr ""

msgid "The suboffsets array is read-only for the consumer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is for use internally by the exporting object. For example, this might "
"be re-cast as an integer by the exporter and used to store flags about "
"whether or not the shape, strides, and suboffsets arrays must be freed when "
"the buffer is released. The consumer MUST NOT alter this value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Buffer request types"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Buffers are usually obtained by sending a buffer request to an exporting "
"object via :c:func:`PyObject_GetBuffer`. Since the complexity of the logical "

"argument to specify the exact buffer type it can handle."
