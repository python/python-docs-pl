msgid "Weak Reference Objects"

"Python supports *weak references* as first-class objects.  There are two "
"specific object types which directly implement weak references.  The first "
"is a simple reference object, and the second acts as a proxy for the "
"original object as much as it can."

"Return a weak reference object for the object *ob*.  This will always return "
"a new reference, but is not guaranteed to create a new object; an existing "
"reference object may be returned.  The second parameter, *callback*, can be "
"a callable object that receives notification when *ob* is garbage collected; "
"it should accept a single parameter, which will be the weak reference object "
"itself. *callback* may also be ``None`` or ``NULL``.  If *ob* is not a "
"weakly referencable object, or if *callback* is not callable, ``None``, or "
"``NULL``, this will return ``NULL`` and raise :exc:`TypeError`."

"This function returns a :term:`borrowed reference` to the referenced object. "
"This means that you should always call :c:func:`Py_INCREF` on the object "
"except when it cannot be destroyed before the last usage of the borrowed "
"reference."
msgstr ""

msgid "Similar to :c:func:`PyWeakref_GetObject`, but does no error checking."

msgid ""
"This function is called by the :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_dealloc` handler "
"to clear weak references."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This iterates through the weak references for *object* and calls callbacks "
"for those references which have one. It returns when all callbacks have been "
"attempted."
