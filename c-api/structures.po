"All Python objects ultimately share a small number of fields at the "

msgid ""
"All object types are extensions of this type.  This is a type which contains "

"In a normal \"release\" build, it contains only the object's reference count "

"to be a :c:type:`PyObject`, but every pointer to a Python object can be cast "

msgid "flags bits indicating how the call should be constructed"

"The :c:member:`ml_meth` is a C function pointer.  The functions may be of "

"binding convention."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are these calling conventions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the typical calling convention, where the methods have the type :c:"
"type:`PyCFunction`. The function expects two :c:expr:`PyObject*` values. The "
"first one is the *self* object for methods; for module functions, it is the "
"module object.  The second parameter (often called *args*) is a tuple object "
"representing all arguments. This parameter is typically processed using :c:"
"func:`PyArg_ParseTuple` or :c:func:`PyArg_UnpackTuple`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Methods with these flags must be of type :c:type:`PyCFunctionWithKeywords`. "
"The function expects three parameters: *self*, *args*, *kwargs* where "

"if there are no keyword arguments.  The parameters are typically processed "
"using :c:func:`PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords`."

"Extension of :const:`METH_FASTCALL` supporting also keyword arguments, with "
"methods of type :c:type:`_PyCFunctionFastWithKeywords`. Keyword arguments "
"are passed the same way as in the :ref:`vectorcall protocol <vectorcall>`: "
"there is an additional fourth :c:expr:`PyObject*` parameter which is a tuple "
"representing the names of the keyword arguments (which are guaranteed to be "
"strings) or possibly ``NULL`` if there are no keywords.  The values of the "
"keyword arguments are stored in the *args* array, after the positional "
"arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Extension of :const:`METH_FASTCALL | METH_KEYWORDS` supporting the *defining "
"class*, that is, the class that contains the method in question. The "
"defining class might be a superclass of ``Py_TYPE(self)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The method needs to be of type :c:type:`PyCMethod`, the same as for "
"``METH_FASTCALL | METH_KEYWORDS`` with ``defining_class`` argument added "
"after ``self``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Methods without parameters don't need to check whether arguments are given "
"if they are listed with the :const:`METH_NOARGS` flag.  They need to be of "
"type :c:type:`PyCFunction`.  The first parameter is typically named *self* "
"and will hold a reference to the module or object instance.  In all cases "
"the second parameter will be ``NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function must have 2 parameters. Since the second parameter is unused, :"
"c:macro:`Py_UNUSED` can be used to prevent a compiler warning."

"Methods with a single object argument can be listed with the :const:`METH_O` "
"flag, instead of invoking :c:func:`PyArg_ParseTuple` with a ``\"O\"`` "
"argument. They have the type :c:type:`PyCFunction`, with the *self* "
"parameter, and a :c:expr:`PyObject*` parameter representing the single "
"argument."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These two constants are not used to indicate the calling convention but the "
"binding when use with methods of classes.  These may not be used for "
"functions defined for modules.  At most one of these flags may be set for "
"any given method."
msgstr ""
"Te dwie stałe nie są używane do zaznaczania konwencji wywoływania, ale wiążą "

"określonych dla modułów. Co najwyżej jedna z tych flag może być ustawiona "
"dla dowolnej danej metody."

"The method will be passed the type object as the first parameter rather than "

msgid ""
"One other constant controls whether a method is loaded in place of another "
"definition with the same method name."
msgstr ""
"Jedna pozostała stała kontroluje czy metoda jest ładowana w miejscu innej "
"definicji o tej samej nazwie metody."

msgid ""
"The method will be loaded in place of existing definitions.  Without "
"*METH_COEXIST*, the default is to skip repeated definitions.  Since slot "
"wrappers are loaded before the method table, the existence of a "
"*sq_contains* slot, for example, would generate a wrapped method named :meth:"
"`__contains__` and preclude the loading of a corresponding PyCFunction with "
"the same name.  With the flag defined, the PyCFunction will be loaded in "
"place of the wrapper object and will co-exist with the slot.  This is "
"helpful because calls to PyCFunctions are optimized more than wrapper object "
"calls."
msgstr ""
"Metoda zostanie załadowana w miejsce istniejących definicji. Bez "
"*METH_COEXIST*, domyślnie pomija się powtórzone definicje. Od kiedy "
"opakowania gniazd są ładowane przed tabelą metod, istnienie na przykład "
"gniazda *sq_contains* generuje opakowaną metodę nazywaną :meth:"
"`__contains__` i zapobiega ładowaniu odpowiadającej funkcji PyCFunction o "
"tej samej nazwie. Ze zdefiniowaną flagą, PyCFunction zostanie załadowana w "
"miejsce obiektu opakowania i będzie współistniała z gniazdem. To jest "
"pomocne ponieważ wywołania PyCFunction są zoptymalizowane bardziej niż "
"odwołania do obiektów opakowań."
