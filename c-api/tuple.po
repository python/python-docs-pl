msgid "Tuple Objects"

msgid "This subtype of :c:type:`PyObject` represents a Python tuple object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This instance of :c:type:`PyTypeObject` represents the Python tuple type; it "
"is the same object as :class:`tuple` in the Python layer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return true if *p* is a tuple object or an instance of a subtype of the "
"tuple type.  This function always succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return true if *p* is a tuple object, but not an instance of a subtype of "
"the tuple type.  This function always succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return a new tuple object of size *len*, or ``NULL`` on failure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a new tuple object of size *n*, or ``NULL`` on failure. The tuple "
"values are initialized to the subsequent *n* C arguments pointing to Python "
"objects. ``PyTuple_Pack(2, a, b)`` is equivalent to "
"``Py_BuildValue(\"(OO)\", a, b)``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Take a pointer to a tuple object, and return the size of that tuple."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the size of the tuple *p*, which must be non-``NULL`` and point to a "
"tuple; no error checking is performed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the object at position *pos* in the tuple pointed to by *p*.  If "
"*pos* is negative or out of bounds, return ``NULL`` and set an :exc:"
"`IndexError` exception."
msgstr ""

msgid "Like :c:func:`PyTuple_GetItem`, but does no checking of its arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the slice of the tuple pointed to by *p* between *low* and *high*, or "
"``NULL`` on failure.  This is the equivalent of the Python expression "
"``p[low:high]``.  Indexing from the end of the tuple is not supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Insert a reference to object *o* at position *pos* of the tuple pointed to "
"by *p*.  Return ``0`` on success.  If *pos* is out of bounds, return ``-1`` "
"and set an :exc:`IndexError` exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function \"steals\" a reference to *o* and discards a reference to an "
"item already in the tuple at the affected position."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like :c:func:`PyTuple_SetItem`, but does no error checking, and should "
"*only* be used to fill in brand new tuples."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function \"steals\" a reference to *o*, and, unlike :c:func:"
"`PyTuple_SetItem`, does *not* discard a reference to any item that is being "
"replaced; any reference in the tuple at position *pos* will be leaked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Can be used to resize a tuple.  *newsize* will be the new length of the "
"tuple. Because tuples are *supposed* to be immutable, this should only be "
"used if there is only one reference to the object.  Do *not* use this if the "
"tuple may already be known to some other part of the code.  The tuple will "
"always grow or shrink at the end.  Think of this as destroying the old tuple "
"and creating a new one, only more efficiently.  Returns ``0`` on success. "
"Client code should never assume that the resulting value of ``*p`` will be "
"the same as before calling this function. If the object referenced by ``*p`` "
"is replaced, the original ``*p`` is destroyed.  On failure, returns ``-1`` "
"and sets ``*p`` to ``NULL``, and raises :exc:`MemoryError` or :exc:"
"`SystemError`."

msgid "Struct Sequence Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Struct sequence objects are the C equivalent of :func:`~collections."
"namedtuple` objects, i.e. a sequence whose items can also be accessed "
"through attributes. To create a struct sequence, you first have to create a "
"specific struct sequence type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new struct sequence type from the data in *desc*, described below. "
"Instances of the resulting type can be created with :c:func:"
"`PyStructSequence_New`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Initializes a struct sequence type *type* from *desc* in place."
msgstr ""
