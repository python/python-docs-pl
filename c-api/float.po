"This subtype of :c:type:`PyObject` represents a Python floating point object."

msgid ""
"This instance of :c:type:`PyTypeObject` represents the Python floating point "

msgid ""
"Return true if its argument is a :c:type:`PyFloatObject` or a subtype of :c:"
"type:`PyFloatObject`.  This function always succeeds."

msgid ""
"Return true if its argument is a :c:type:`PyFloatObject`, but not a subtype "
"of :c:type:`PyFloatObject`.  This function always succeeds."

"Create a :c:type:`PyFloatObject` object based on the string value in *str*, "
"or ``NULL`` on failure."

msgid ""
"Create a :c:type:`PyFloatObject` object from *v*, or ``NULL`` on failure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a C :c:expr:`double` representation of the contents of *pyfloat*.  If "
"*pyfloat* is not a Python floating point object but has a :meth:`__float__` "
"method, this method will first be called to convert *pyfloat* into a float. "
"If ``__float__()`` is not defined then it falls back to :meth:`__index__`. "
"This method returns ``-1.0`` upon failure, so one should call :c:func:"
"`PyErr_Occurred` to check for errors."
msgstr ""

msgid "Use :meth:`__index__` if available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a C :c:expr:`double` representation of the contents of *pyfloat*, but "
"without error checking."

"Return a structseq instance which contains information about the precision, "
"minimum and maximum values of a float. It's a thin wrapper around the header "

msgid "Pack and Unpack functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The pack and unpack functions provide an efficient platform-independent way "
"to store floating-point values as byte strings. The Pack routines produce a "
"bytes string from a C :c:expr:`double`, and the Unpack routines produce a C :"
"c:expr:`double` from such a bytes string. The suffix (2, 4 or 8) specifies "
"the number of bytes in the bytes string."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On platforms that appear to use IEEE 754 formats these functions work by "
"copying bits. On other platforms, the 2-byte format is identical to the IEEE "
"754 binary16 half-precision format, the 4-byte format (32-bit) is identical "
"to the IEEE 754 binary32 single precision format, and the 8-byte format to "
"the IEEE 754 binary64 double precision format, although the packing of INFs "
"and NaNs (if such things exist on the platform) isn't handled correctly, and "
"attempting to unpack a bytes string containing an IEEE INF or NaN will raise "
"an exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On non-IEEE platforms with more precision, or larger dynamic range, than "
"IEEE 754 supports, not all values can be packed; on non-IEEE platforms with "
"less precision, or smaller dynamic range, not all values can be unpacked. "
"What happens in such cases is partly accidental (alas)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pack functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The pack routines write 2, 4 or 8 bytes, starting at *p*. *le* is an :c:expr:"
"`int` argument, non-zero if you want the bytes string in little-endian "
"format (exponent last, at ``p+1``, ``p+3``, or ``p+6`` ``p+7``), zero if you "
"want big-endian format (exponent first, at *p*). The :c:data:`PY_BIG_ENDIAN` "
"constant can be used to use the native endian: it is equal to ``1`` on big "
"endian processor, or ``0`` on little endian processor."
