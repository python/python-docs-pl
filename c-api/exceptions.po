msgid "Exception Handling"
msgstr "Obsługa sytuacji wyjątkowych"

msgid ""
"The functions described in this chapter will let you handle and raise Python "
"exceptions.  It is important to understand some of the basics of Python "
"exception handling.  It works somewhat like the POSIX :c:data:`errno` "
"variable: there is a global indicator (per thread) of the last error that "
"occurred.  Most C API functions don't clear this on success, but will set it "
"to indicate the cause of the error on failure.  Most C API functions also "
"return an error indicator, usually ``NULL`` if they are supposed to return a "
"pointer, or ``-1`` if they return an integer (exception: the ``PyArg_*`` "
"functions return ``1`` for success and ``0`` for failure)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Concretely, the error indicator consists of three object pointers: the "
"exception's type, the exception's value, and the traceback object.  Any of "
"those pointers can be ``NULL`` if non-set (although some combinations are "
"forbidden, for example you can't have a non-``NULL`` traceback if the "
"exception type is ``NULL``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a function must fail because some function it called failed, it "
"generally doesn't set the error indicator; the function it called already "
"set it.  It is responsible for either handling the error and clearing the "
"exception or returning after cleaning up any resources it holds (such as "
"object references or memory allocations); it should *not* continue normally "
"if it is not prepared to handle the error.  If returning due to an error, it "
"is important to indicate to the caller that an error has been set.  If the "
"error is not handled or carefully propagated, additional calls into the "
"Python/C API may not behave as intended and may fail in mysterious ways."
msgstr ""
"Gdy zadanie musi zawieźć z powodu błędu zadania które wywołało, ogólnie nie "

"wskaźnika sytuacji wyjątkowej lub powrót po sprzątnięciu jakichkolwiek "
"zasobów które utrzymuje (takich jak odwołania do przedmiotów lub zajęte "
"pamięci); *nie* powinien kontynuować zwyczajnie jeśli nie jest przygotowany "
"do obsługi błędu. Jeśli kończy z powodu błędu, istotne jest zwrócenie uwagi "

"The error indicator is **not** the result of :func:`sys.exc_info()`. The "

msgid "Raising exceptions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These functions help you set the current thread's error indicator. For "
"convenience, some of these functions will always return a ``NULL`` pointer "
"for use in a ``return`` statement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the most common way to set the error indicator.  The first argument "
"specifies the exception type; it is normally one of the standard exceptions, "
"e.g. :c:data:`PyExc_RuntimeError`.  You need not increment its reference "
"count. The second argument is an error message; it is decoded from "
"``'utf-8'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is similar to :c:func:`PyErr_SetString` but lets you specify "
"an arbitrary Python object for the \"value\" of the exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function sets the error indicator and returns ``NULL``.  *exception* "
"should be a Python exception class.  The *format* and subsequent parameters "
"help format the error message; they have the same meaning and values as in :"
"c:func:`PyUnicode_FromFormat`. *format* is an ASCII-encoded string."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Same as :c:func:`PyErr_Format`, but taking a :c:type:`va_list` argument "
"rather than a variable number of arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a shorthand for ``PyErr_SetObject(type, Py_None)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a shorthand for ``PyErr_SetString(PyExc_TypeError, message)``, where "
"*message* indicates that a built-in operation was invoked with an illegal "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a shorthand for ``PyErr_SetNone(PyExc_MemoryError)``; it returns "
"``NULL`` so an object allocation function can write ``return "
"PyErr_NoMemory();`` when it runs out of memory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a convenience function to raise an exception when a C library "
"function has returned an error and set the C variable :c:data:`errno`.  It "
"constructs a tuple object whose first item is the integer :c:data:`errno` "
"value and whose second item is the corresponding error message (gotten from :"
"c:func:`strerror`), and then calls ``PyErr_SetObject(type, object)``.  On "
"Unix, when the :c:data:`errno` value is :const:`EINTR`, indicating an "
"interrupted system call, this calls :c:func:`PyErr_CheckSignals`, and if "
"that set the error indicator, leaves it set to that.  The function always "
"returns ``NULL``, so a wrapper function around a system call can write "
"``return PyErr_SetFromErrno(type);`` when the system call returns an error."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :c:func:`PyErr_SetFromErrno`, with the additional behavior that "
"if *filenameObject* is not ``NULL``, it is passed to the constructor of "
"*type* as a third parameter.  In the case of :exc:`OSError` exception, this "
"is used to define the :attr:`filename` attribute of the exception instance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :c:func:`PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilenameObject`, but takes a "
"second filename object, for raising errors when a function that takes two "
"filenames fails."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :c:func:`PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilenameObject`, but the filename "
"is given as a C string.  *filename* is decoded from the :term:`filesystem "
"encoding and error handler`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a convenience function to raise :exc:`WindowsError`. If called with "
"*ierr* of ``0``, the error code returned by a call to :c:func:`GetLastError` "
"is used instead.  It calls the Win32 function :c:func:`FormatMessage` to "
"retrieve the Windows description of error code given by *ierr* or :c:func:"
"`GetLastError`, then it constructs a tuple object whose first item is the "
"*ierr* value and whose second item is the corresponding error message "
"(gotten from :c:func:`FormatMessage`), and then calls "
"``PyErr_SetObject(PyExc_WindowsError, object)``. This function always "
"returns ``NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`Availability <availability>`: Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :c:func:`PyErr_SetFromWindowsErr`, with an additional parameter "
"specifying the exception type to be raised."
msgstr ""

"be ``NULL``, will be set as the :exc:`ImportError`'s respective ``name`` and "
"``path`` attributes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Much like :c:func:`PyErr_SetImportError` but this function allows for "
"specifying a subclass of :exc:`ImportError` to raise."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set file, line, and offset information for the current exception.  If the "
"current exception is not a :exc:`SyntaxError`, then it sets additional "
"attributes, which make the exception printing subsystem think the exception "
"is a :exc:`SyntaxError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like :c:func:`PyErr_SyntaxLocationObject`, but *filename* is a byte string "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like :c:func:`PyErr_SyntaxLocationEx`, but the *col_offset* parameter is "
"omitted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a shorthand for ``PyErr_SetString(PyExc_SystemError, message)``, "

"function) was invoked with an illegal argument.  It is mostly for internal "
"use."
msgstr ""

msgid "Issuing warnings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use these functions to issue warnings from C code.  They mirror similar "
"functions exported by the Python :mod:`warnings` module.  They normally "
"print a warning message to *sys.stderr*; however, it is also possible that "
"the user has specified that warnings are to be turned into errors, and in "
"that case they will raise an exception.  It is also possible that the "
"functions raise an exception because of a problem with the warning "
"machinery. The return value is ``0`` if no exception is raised, or ``-1`` if "
"an exception is raised.  (It is not possible to determine whether a warning "
"message is actually printed, nor what the reason is for the exception; this "
"is intentional.)  If an exception is raised, the caller should do its normal "
"exception handling (for example, :c:func:`Py_DECREF` owned references and "
"return an error value)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Issue a warning message.  The *category* argument is a warning category (see "
"below) or ``NULL``; the *message* argument is a UTF-8 encoded string.  "
"*stack_level* is a positive number giving a number of stack frames; the "
"warning will be issued from the  currently executing line of code in that "
"stack frame.  A *stack_level* of 1 is the function calling :c:func:"
"`PyErr_WarnEx`, 2 is  the function above that, and so forth."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Warning categories must be subclasses of :c:data:`PyExc_Warning`; :c:data:"
"`PyExc_Warning` is a subclass of :c:data:`PyExc_Exception`; the default "
"warning category is :c:data:`PyExc_RuntimeWarning`. The standard Python "
"warning categories are available as global variables whose names are "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For information about warning control, see the documentation for the :mod:"

"warn_explicit`; see there for more information.  The *module* and *registry* "
"arguments may be set to ``NULL`` to get the default effect described there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :c:func:`PyErr_WarnExplicitObject` except that *message* and "
"*module* are UTF-8 encoded strings, and *filename* is decoded from the :term:"
"`filesystem encoding and error handler`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Test whether the error indicator is set.  If set, return the exception "
"*type* (the first argument to the last call to one of the ``PyErr_Set*`` "

"do not own a reference to the return value, so you do not need to :c:func:"
"`Py_DECREF` it."
msgstr ""

msgid "The caller must hold the GIL."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Do not compare the return value to a specific exception; use :c:func:"
"`PyErr_ExceptionMatches` instead, shown below.  (The comparison could easily "
"fail since the exception may be an instance instead of a class, in the case "
"of a class exception, or it may be a subclass of the expected exception.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Equivalent to ``PyErr_GivenExceptionMatches(PyErr_Occurred(), exc)``.  This "

msgid ""
"Return true if the *given* exception matches the exception type in *exc*.  "
"If *exc* is a class object, this also returns true when *given* is an "
