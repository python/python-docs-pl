"These APIs are a minimal emulation of the Python 2 C API for built-in file "
"objects, which used to rely on the buffered I/O (:c:expr:`FILE*`) support "
"from the C standard library.  In Python 3, files and streams use the new :"
"mod:`io` module, which defines several layers over the low-level unbuffered "
"I/O of the operating system.  The functions described below are convenience "
"C wrappers over these new APIs, and meant mostly for internal error "
"reporting in the interpreter; third-party code is advised to access the :mod:"
"`io` APIs instead."

msgid ""
"Create a Python file object from the file descriptor of an already opened "
"file *fd*.  The arguments *name*, *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* can be "
"``NULL`` to use the defaults; *buffering* can be *-1* to use the default. "
"*name* is ignored and kept for backward compatibility. Return ``NULL`` on "
"failure. For a more comprehensive description of the arguments, please refer "
"to the :func:`io.open` function documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since Python streams have their own buffering layer, mixing them with OS-"
"level file descriptors can produce various issues (such as unexpected "
"ordering of data)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ignore *name* attribute."
msgstr "Zignoruj atrybut *name*."

msgid ""
"Return the file descriptor associated with *p* as an :c:expr:`int`.  If the "
"object is an integer, its value is returned.  If not, the object's :meth:"
"`~io.IOBase.fileno` method is called if it exists; the method must return an "
"integer, which is returned as the file descriptor value.  Sets an exception "
"and returns ``-1`` on failure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Equivalent to ``p.readline([n])``, this function reads one line from the "
"object *p*.  *p* may be a file object or any object with a :meth:`~io.IOBase."
"readline` method.  If *n* is ``0``, exactly one line is read, regardless of "
"the length of the line.  If *n* is greater than ``0``, no more than *n* "
"bytes will be read from the file; a partial line can be returned.  In both "
"cases, an empty string is returned if the end of the file is reached "
"immediately.  If *n* is less than ``0``, however, one line is read "
"regardless of length, but :exc:`EOFError` is raised if the end of the file "
"is reached immediately."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Overrides the normal behavior of :func:`io.open_code` to pass its parameter "
"through the provided handler."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The handler is a function of type :c:expr:`PyObject *(\\*)(PyObject *path, "
"void *userData)`, where *path* is guaranteed to be :c:type:`PyUnicodeObject`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *userData* pointer is passed into the hook function. Since hook "
"functions may be called from different runtimes, this pointer should not "
"refer directly to Python state."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As this hook is intentionally used during import, avoid importing new "
"modules during its execution unless they are known to be frozen or available "
"in ``sys.modules``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once a hook has been set, it cannot be removed or replaced, and later calls "
"to :c:func:`PyFile_SetOpenCodeHook` will fail. On failure, the function "
"returns -1 and sets an exception if the interpreter has been initialized."
msgstr ""

msgid "This function is safe to call before :c:func:`Py_Initialize`."
msgstr ""
"Funkcja ta może być bezpiecznie wywołana przed :c:func:`Py_Initialize`."

"arguments."

"Write object *obj* to file object *p*.  The only supported flag for *flags* "
"is :const:`Py_PRINT_RAW`; if given, the :func:`str` of the object is written "
"instead of the :func:`repr`.  Return ``0`` on success or ``-1`` on failure; "
"the appropriate exception will be set."
