msgid ""
"This instance of :c:type:`PyTypeObject` represents the Python module type.  "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return true if *p* is a module object, but not a subtype of :c:data:"
"`PyModule_Type`.  This function always succeeds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a new module object with the :attr:`__name__` attribute set to "
"*name*. The module's :attr:`__name__`, :attr:`__doc__`, :attr:`__package__`, "
"and :attr:`__loader__` attributes are filled in (all but :attr:`__name__` "

msgstr ""

msgid ":attr:`__package__` and :attr:`__loader__` are set to ``None``."

msgid ""
"Similar to :c:func:`PyModule_NewObject`, but the name is a UTF-8 encoded "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the dictionary object that implements *module*'s namespace; this "
"object is the same as the :attr:`~object.__dict__` attribute of the module "
"object. If *module* is not a module object (or a subtype of a module "
"object), :exc:`SystemError` is raised and ``NULL`` is returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is recommended extensions use other ``PyModule_*`` and ``PyObject_*`` "
"functions rather than directly manipulate a module's :attr:`~object."
"__dict__`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return *module*'s :attr:`__name__` value.  If the module does not provide "
"one, or if it is not a string, :exc:`SystemError` is raised and ``NULL`` is "
"returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :c:func:`PyModule_GetNameObject` but return the name encoded to "
"``'utf-8'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the \"state\" of the module, that is, a pointer to the block of "

"`PyModuleDef.m_size`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a pointer to the :c:type:`PyModuleDef` struct from which the module "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the name of the file from which *module* was loaded using *module*'s :"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
":c:func:`PyModule_GetFilename` raises :c:type:`UnicodeEncodeError` on "
"unencodable filenames, use :c:func:`PyModule_GetFilenameObject` instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Initializing C modules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Modules objects are usually created from extension modules (shared libraries "
"which export an initialization function), or compiled-in modules (where the "
"initialization function is added using :c:func:`PyImport_AppendInittab`). "
"See :ref:`building` or :ref:`extending-with-embedding` for details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The initialization function can either pass a module definition instance to :"
"c:func:`PyModule_Create`, and return the resulting module object, or request "
"\"multi-phase initialization\" by returning the definition struct itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module definition struct, which holds all information needed to create a "
"module object. There is usually only one statically initialized variable of "
"this type for each module."
msgstr ""

msgid "Always initialize this member to :const:`PyModuleDef_HEAD_INIT`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Name for the new module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Docstring for the module; usually a docstring variable created with :c:macro:"
"`PyDoc_STRVAR` is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Module state may be kept in a per-module memory area that can be retrieved "
"with :c:func:`PyModule_GetState`, rather than in static globals. This makes "
"modules safe for use in multiple sub-interpreters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This memory area is allocated based on *m_size* on module creation, and "
"freed when the module object is deallocated, after the :c:member:`m_free` "
"function has been called, if present."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting ``m_size`` to ``-1`` means that the module does not support sub-"
"interpreters, because it has global state."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting it to a non-negative value means that the module can be re-"
"initialized and specifies the additional amount of memory it requires for "
"its state. Non-negative ``m_size`` is required for multi-phase "
"initialization."
msgstr ""

msgid "See :PEP:`3121` for more details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A pointer to a table of module-level functions, described by :c:type:"
"`PyMethodDef` values.  Can be ``NULL`` if no functions are present."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An array of slot definitions for multi-phase initialization, terminated by a "
"``{0, NULL}`` entry. When using single-phase initialization, *m_slots* must "
"be ``NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Prior to version 3.5, this member was always set to ``NULL``, and was "
"defined as:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A traversal function to call during GC traversal of the module object, or "
"``NULL`` if not needed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is not called if the module state was requested but is not "
"allocated yet. This is the case immediately after the module is created and "
"before the module is executed (:c:data:`Py_mod_exec` function). More "
"precisely, this function is not called if :c:member:`m_size` is greater than "
"0 and the module state (as returned by :c:func:`PyModule_GetState`) is "
"``NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid "No longer called before the module state is allocated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A clear function to call during GC clearing of the module object, or "
"``NULL`` if not needed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like :c:member:`PyTypeObject.tp_clear`, this function is not *always* called "
"before a module is deallocated. For example, when reference counting is "
"enough to determine that an object is no longer used, the cyclic garbage "
"collector is not involved and :c:member:`~PyModuleDef.m_free` is called "
"directly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A function to call during deallocation of the module object, or ``NULL`` if "
"not needed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Single-phase initialization"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module initialization function may create and return the module object "
"directly. This is referred to as \"single-phase initialization\", and uses "
"one of the following two module creation functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new module object, given the definition in *def*.  This behaves "
"like :c:func:`PyModule_Create2` with *module_api_version* set to :const:"
"`PYTHON_API_VERSION`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new module object, given the definition in *def*, assuming the API "
"version *module_api_version*.  If that version does not match the version of "
"the running interpreter, a :exc:`RuntimeWarning` is emitted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most uses of this function should be using :c:func:`PyModule_Create` "
"instead; only use this if you are sure you need it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before it is returned from in the initialization function, the resulting "
"module object is typically populated using functions like :c:func:"
"`PyModule_AddObjectRef`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Multi-phase initialization"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An alternate way to specify extensions is to request \"multi-phase "
"initialization\". Extension modules created this way behave more like Python "
"modules: the initialization is split between the *creation phase*, when the "
"module object is created, and the *execution phase*, when it is populated. "
"The distinction is similar to the :py:meth:`__new__` and :py:meth:`__init__` "
"methods of classes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike modules created using single-phase initialization, these modules are "
"not singletons: if the *sys.modules* entry is removed and the module is re-"
"imported, a new module object is created, and the old module is subject to "
"normal garbage collection -- as with Python modules. By default, multiple "
"modules created from the same definition should be independent: changes to "
"one should not affect the others. This means that all state should be "
"specific to the module object (using e.g. using :c:func:"
"`PyModule_GetState`), or its contents (such as the module's :attr:`__dict__` "
"or individual classes created with :c:func:`PyType_FromSpec`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All modules created using multi-phase initialization are expected to "
"support :ref:`sub-interpreters <sub-interpreter-support>`. Making sure "
"multiple modules are independent is typically enough to achieve this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To request multi-phase initialization, the initialization function "
"(PyInit_modulename) returns a :c:type:`PyModuleDef` instance with non-empty :"
"c:member:`~PyModuleDef.m_slots`. Before it is returned, the ``PyModuleDef`` "
"instance must be initialized with the following function:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ensures a module definition is a properly initialized Python object that "
"correctly reports its type and reference count."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns *def* cast to ``PyObject*``, or ``NULL`` if an error occurred."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *m_slots* member of the module definition must point to an array of "
"``PyModuleDef_Slot`` structures:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A slot ID, chosen from the available values explained below."
msgstr ""

msgid "Value of the slot, whose meaning depends on the slot ID."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *m_slots* array must be terminated by a slot with id 0."
msgstr ""

msgid "The available slot types are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Specifies a function that is called to create the module object itself. The "
"*value* pointer of this slot must point to a function of the signature:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function receives a :py:class:`~importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec` "
"instance, as defined in :PEP:`451`, and the module definition. It should "
"return a new module object, or set an error and return ``NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function should be kept minimal. In particular, it should not call "
"arbitrary Python code, as trying to import the same module again may result "
"in an infinite loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multiple ``Py_mod_create`` slots may not be specified in one module "
"definition."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``Py_mod_create`` is not specified, the import machinery will create a "
"normal module object using :c:func:`PyModule_New`. The name is taken from "
"*spec*, not the definition, to allow extension modules to dynamically adjust "
"to their place in the module hierarchy and be imported under different names "
"through symlinks, all while sharing a single module definition."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is no requirement for the returned object to be an instance of :c:type:"
"`PyModule_Type`. Any type can be used, as long as it supports setting and "
"getting import-related attributes. However, only ``PyModule_Type`` instances "
"may be returned if the ``PyModuleDef`` has non-``NULL`` ``m_traverse``, "
"``m_clear``, ``m_free``; non-zero ``m_size``; or slots other than "
"``Py_mod_create``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Specifies a function that is called to *execute* the module. This is "
"equivalent to executing the code of a Python module: typically, this "
"function adds classes and constants to the module. The signature of the "
"function is:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If multiple ``Py_mod_exec`` slots are specified, they are processed in the "
"order they appear in the *m_slots* array."
msgstr ""

msgid "See :PEP:`489` for more details on multi-phase initialization."
msgstr ""

msgid "Low-level module creation functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following functions are called under the hood when using multi-phase "
"initialization. They can be used directly, for example when creating module "
"objects dynamically. Note that both ``PyModule_FromDefAndSpec`` and "
"``PyModule_ExecDef`` must be called to fully initialize a module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new module object, given the definition in *def* and the ModuleSpec "
"*spec*.  This behaves like :c:func:`PyModule_FromDefAndSpec2` with "
"*module_api_version* set to :const:`PYTHON_API_VERSION`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new module object, given the definition in *def* and the ModuleSpec "
"*spec*, assuming the API version *module_api_version*. If that version does "
"not match the version of the running interpreter, a :exc:`RuntimeWarning` is "
"emitted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most uses of this function should be using :c:func:`PyModule_FromDefAndSpec` "
"instead; only use this if you are sure you need it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Process any execution slots (:c:data:`Py_mod_exec`) given in *def*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the docstring for *module* to *docstring*. This function is called "
"automatically when creating a module from ``PyModuleDef``, using either "
"``PyModule_Create`` or ``PyModule_FromDefAndSpec``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add the functions from the ``NULL`` terminated *functions* array to "
"*module*. Refer to the :c:type:`PyMethodDef` documentation for details on "
"individual entries (due to the lack of a shared module namespace, module "
"level \"functions\" implemented in C typically receive the module as their "
"first parameter, making them similar to instance methods on Python classes). "
"This function is called automatically when creating a module from "
"``PyModuleDef``, using either ``PyModule_Create`` or "
"``PyModule_FromDefAndSpec``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Support functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module initialization function (if using single phase initialization) or "
"a function called from a module execution slot (if using multi-phase "
"initialization), can use the following functions to help initialize the "
"module state:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add an object to *module* as *name*.  This is a convenience function which "
"can be used from the module's initialization function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On success, return ``0``. On error, raise an exception and return ``-1``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``NULL`` if *value* is ``NULL``. It must be called with an exception "
"raised in this case."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example usage::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The example can also be written without checking explicitly if *obj* is "
"``NULL``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that ``Py_XDECREF()`` should be used instead of ``Py_DECREF()`` in this "
"case, since *obj* can be ``NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :c:func:`PyModule_AddObjectRef`, but steals a reference to "
"*value* on success (if it returns ``0``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The new :c:func:`PyModule_AddObjectRef` function is recommended, since it is "
"easy to introduce reference leaks by misusing the :c:func:"
"`PyModule_AddObject` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike other functions that steal references, ``PyModule_AddObject()`` only "
"decrements the reference count of *value* **on success**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means that its return value must be checked, and calling code must :c:"
"func:`Py_DECREF` *value* manually on error."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add an integer constant to *module* as *name*.  This convenience function "
"can be used from the module's initialization function. Return ``-1`` on "
"error, ``0`` on success."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add a string constant to *module* as *name*.  This convenience function can "
"be used from the module's initialization function.  The string *value* must "
"be ``NULL``-terminated.  Return ``-1`` on error, ``0`` on success."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add an int constant to *module*. The name and the value are taken from "
"*macro*. For example ``PyModule_AddIntMacro(module, AF_INET)`` adds the int "
"constant *AF_INET* with the value of *AF_INET* to *module*. Return ``-1`` on "
"error, ``0`` on success."
msgstr ""

msgid "Add a string constant to *module*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add a type object to *module*. The type object is finalized by calling "
"internally :c:func:`PyType_Ready`. The name of the type object is taken from "
"the last component of :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_name` after dot. Return "
"``-1`` on error, ``0`` on success."
msgstr ""

msgid "Module lookup"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Single-phase initialization creates singleton modules that can be looked up "
"in the context of the current interpreter. This allows the module object to "
"be retrieved later with only a reference to the module definition."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These functions will not work on modules created using multi-phase "
"initialization, since multiple such modules can be created from a single "
"definition."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns the module object that was created from *def* for the current "
"interpreter. This method requires that the module object has been attached "
"to the interpreter state with :c:func:`PyState_AddModule` beforehand. In "
"case the corresponding module object is not found or has not been attached "
"to the interpreter state yet, it returns ``NULL``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Attaches the module object passed to the function to the interpreter state. "
"This allows the module object to be accessible via :c:func:"
"`PyState_FindModule`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Only effective on modules created using single-phase initialization."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python calls ``PyState_AddModule`` automatically after importing a module, "
"so it is unnecessary (but harmless) to call it from module initialization "
"code. An explicit call is needed only if the module's own init code "
"subsequently calls ``PyState_FindModule``. The function is mainly intended "
