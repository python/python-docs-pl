"A *virtual environment* is a semi-isolated Python environment that allows "

"``venv`` is the standard tool for creating virtual environments, and has "

"Jest częścią Pythona od wersji 3.3, a od 3.4 domyślnie instaluje ``pip`` we "

msgid ""
"``virtualenv`` is a third party alternative (and predecessor) to ``venv``. "

"It's also possible to specify an exact or minimum version directly on the "

msgstr ""

msgid "... install ``pip`` in versions of Python prior to Python 3.4?"

msgid "... install scientific Python packages?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A number of scientific Python packages have complex binary dependencies, and "
"aren't currently easy to install using ``pip`` directly. At this point in "
"time, it will often be easier for users to install these packages by `other "

"install them with ``pip``."

msgid "Installing into the system Python on Linux"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Linux systems, a Python installation will typically be included as part "
"of the distribution. Installing into this Python installation requires root "
"access to the system, and may interfere with the operation of the system "
"package manager and other components of the system if a component is "
"unexpectedly upgraded using ``pip``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On such systems, it is often better to use a virtual environment or a per-"
"user installation when installing packages with ``pip``."

msgid "Pip not installed"

msgid "Installing binary extensions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python has typically relied heavily on source based distribution, with end "
"users being expected to compile extension modules from source as part of the "
"installation process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the introduction of support for the binary ``wheel`` format, and the "
"ability to publish wheels for at least Windows and macOS through the Python "
"Package Index, this problem is expected to diminish over time, as users are "
"more regularly able to install pre-built extensions rather than needing to "
"build them themselves."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some of the solutions for installing `scientific software <https://packaging."
"python.org/science/>`__ that are not yet available as pre-built ``wheel`` "
"files may also help with obtaining other binary extensions without needing "
"to build them locally."
