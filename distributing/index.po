"As a popular open source development project, Python has an active "

"Python, jako popularny projekt open source, cieszy się aktywnym wsparciem "
"społeczności współtwórców i użytkowników, którzy udostępniają tworzone przez "
"siebie oprogramowanie innym deweloperom Pythona w ramach licencji open "
"source."

"This allows Python users to share and collaborate effectively, benefiting "
"from the solutions others have already created to common (and sometimes even "
"rare!) problems, as well as potentially contributing their own solutions to "
"the common pool."
msgstr ""
"Dzięki temu użytkownicy Pythona mogą efektywnie korzystać się i "
"współpracować korzystając z rozwiązań stworzonych wcześniej w odpowiedzi na "
"popularne problemy (a czasami bardzo rzadkie!), oraz udostępniać własne "

"uwagę, że wiele organizacji ma własne zasady dotyczące korzystania z "

msgid ""
"the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.org>`__ is a public repository of "
"open source licensed packages made available for use by other Python users"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"the `Python Packaging Authority <https://www.pypa.io/>`__ are the group of "
"developers and documentation authors responsible for the maintenance and "
"evolution of the standard packaging tools and the associated metadata and "
"file format standards. They maintain a variety of tools, documentation and "
"issue trackers on both `GitHub <https://github.com/pypa>`__ and `Bitbucket "
"<https://bitbucket.org/pypa/>`__."

msgid ""
":mod:`distutils` is the original build and distribution system first added "
"to the Python standard library in 1998. While direct use of :mod:`distutils` "
"is being phased out, it still laid the foundation for the current packaging "
"and distribution infrastructure, and it not only remains part of the "
"standard library, but its name lives on in other ways (such as the name of "
"the mailing list used to coordinate Python packaging standards development)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`setuptools`_ is a (largely) drop-in replacement for :mod:`distutils` first "
"published in 2004. Its most notable addition over the unmodified :mod:"
"`distutils` tools was the ability to declare dependencies on other packages. "
"It is currently recommended as a more regularly updated alternative to :mod:"
"`distutils` that offers consistent support for more recent packaging "
"standards across a wide range of Python versions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`wheel`_ (in this context) is a project that adds the ``bdist_wheel`` "
"command to :mod:`distutils`/`setuptools`_. This produces a cross platform "
"binary packaging format (called \"wheels\" or \"wheel files\" and defined "
"in :pep:`427`) that allows Python libraries, even those including binary "
"extensions, to be installed on a system without needing to be built locally."

msgid "Open source licensing and collaboration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In most parts of the world, software is automatically covered by copyright. "
"This means that other developers require explicit permission to copy, use, "
"modify and redistribute the software."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open source licensing is a way of explicitly granting such permission in a "
"relatively consistent way, allowing developers to share and collaborate "
"efficiently by making common solutions to various problems freely available. "
"This leaves many developers free to spend more time focusing on the problems "
"that are relatively unique to their specific situation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The distribution tools provided with Python are designed to make it "
"reasonably straightforward for developers to make their own contributions "
"back to that common pool of software if they choose to do so."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same distribution tools can also be used to distribute software within "
"an organisation, regardless of whether that software is published as open "
"source software or not."
msgstr ""

msgid "Installing the tools"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The standard library does not include build tools that support modern Python "
"packaging standards, as the core development team has found that it is "
"important to have standard tools that work consistently, even on older "
"versions of Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The currently recommended build and distribution tools can be installed by "
"invoking the ``pip`` module at the command line::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For POSIX users (including macOS and Linux users), these instructions assume "
"the use of a :term:`virtual environment`."

"For Windows users, these instructions assume that the option to adjust the "

msgid "This isn't an easy topic, but here are a few tips:"
msgstr ""

msgid "check the Python Package Index to see if the name is already in use"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"check popular hosting sites like GitHub, Bitbucket, etc to see if there is "
"already a project with that name"
msgstr ""

msgid "check what comes up in a web search for the name you're considering"
