msgid ""
"Python applications will often use packages and modules that don't come as "
"part of the standard library.  Applications will sometimes need a specific "
"version of a library, because the application may require that a particular "
"bug has been fixed or the application may be written using an obsolete "
"version of the library's interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means it may not be possible for one Python installation to meet the "
"requirements of every application.  If application A needs version 1.0 of a "
"particular module but application B needs version 2.0, then the requirements "
"are in conflict and installing either version 1.0 or 2.0 will leave one "
"application unable to run."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The solution for this problem is to create a :term:`virtual environment`, a "
"self-contained directory tree that contains a Python installation for a "
"particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Different applications can then use different virtual environments. To "
"resolve the earlier example of conflicting requirements, application A can "
"have its own virtual environment with version 1.0 installed while "
"application B has another virtual environment with version 2.0. If "
"application B requires a library be upgraded to version 3.0, this will not "
"affect application A's environment."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating Virtual Environments"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module used to create and manage virtual environments is called :mod:"
"`venv`.  :mod:`venv` will usually install the most recent version of Python "
"that you have available. If you have multiple versions of Python on your "
"system, you can select a specific Python version by running ``python3`` or "
"whichever version you want."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to "
"place it, and run the :mod:`venv` module as a script with the directory "
"path::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This will create the ``tutorial-env`` directory if it doesn't exist, and "
"also create directories inside it containing a copy of the Python "
"interpreter and various supporting files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common directory location for a virtual environment is ``.venv``. This "
"name keeps the directory typically hidden in your shell and thus out of the "
"way while giving it a name that explains why the directory exists. It also "
"prevents clashing with ``.env`` environment variable definition files that "
"some tooling supports."
msgstr ""

msgid "Once you've created a virtual environment, you may activate it."
msgstr ""

msgid "On Windows, run::"
msgstr ""

msgid "On Unix or MacOS, run::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"(This script is written for the bash shell.  If you use the :program:`csh` "
"or :program:`fish` shells, there are alternate ``activate.csh`` and "
"``activate.fish`` scripts you should use instead.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Activating the virtual environment will change your shell's prompt to show "
"what virtual environment you're using, and modify the environment so that "
"running ``python`` will get you that particular version and installation of "
"Python. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Managing Packages with pip"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can install, upgrade, and remove packages using a program called :"
"program:`pip`.  By default ``pip`` will install packages from the Python "
"Package Index, <https://pypi.org>.  You can browse the Python Package Index "
"by going to it in your web browser."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``pip`` has a number of subcommands: \"install\", \"uninstall\", \"freeze\", "
"etc.  (Consult the :ref:`installing-index` guide for complete documentation "
"for ``pip``.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can install the latest version of a package by specifying a package's "
"name:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also install a specific version of a package by giving the package "
"name  followed by ``==`` and the version number:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you re-run this command, ``pip`` will notice that the requested version "
"is already installed and do nothing.  You can supply a different version "
"number to get that version, or you can run ``pip install --upgrade`` to "
"upgrade the package to the latest version:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``pip uninstall`` followed by one or more package names will remove the "
"packages from the virtual environment."
msgstr ""

msgid "``pip show`` will display information about a particular package:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``pip list`` will display all of the packages installed in the virtual "
"environment:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``pip freeze`` will produce a similar list of the installed packages, but "
"the output uses the format that ``pip install`` expects. A common convention "
"is to put this list in a ``requirements.txt`` file:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``requirements.txt`` can then be committed to version control and "
"shipped as part of an application.  Users can then install all the necessary "
"packages with ``install -r``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``pip`` has many more options.  Consult the :ref:`installing-index` guide "
"for complete documentation for ``pip``.  When you've written a package and "
"want to make it available on the Python Package Index, consult the :ref:"
"`distributing-index` guide."
