"You should browse through this manual, which gives complete (though terse) "
"reference material about types, functions, and the modules in the standard "
"library.  The standard Python distribution includes a *lot* of additional "
"code. There are modules to read Unix mailboxes, retrieve documents via HTTP, "
"generate random numbers, parse command-line options, write CGI programs, "
"compress data, and many other tasks. Skimming through the Library Reference "
"will give you an idea of what's available."

":ref:`installing-index` explains how to install additional modules written "
"by other Python users."

"language itself."
