msgid "Errors and Exceptions"
msgstr "Błędy i wyjątki"

msgid ""
"Until now error messages haven't been more than mentioned, but if you have "
"tried out the examples you have probably seen some.  There are (at least) "
"two distinguishable kinds of errors: *syntax errors* and *exceptions*."
msgstr ""
"Do tej pory wiadomości o błędach były tylko wspomniane, ale jeśli próbowałaś "
"przykładów to pewnie udało Ci się na nie natknąć. Występują (przynajmniej) "
"dwa charakterystyczne typy błędów: *błędy składni* (syntax errors) oraz "
"*wyjątki* (exceptions)."

msgid "Syntax Errors"
msgstr "Błędy składni"

msgid ""
"Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common "
"kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python::"
msgstr ""
"Błędy składni, inaczej zwane błędami parsowania, to najczęstrze skargi jakie "
"otrzymasz w swoim kierunku gdy wciąż uczysz się Pythona ::"

msgid ""
"The parser repeats the offending line and displays a little 'arrow' pointing "
"at the earliest point in the line where the error was detected.  The error "
"is caused by (or at least detected at) the token *preceding* the arrow: in "
"the example, the error is detected at the function :func:`print`, since a "
"colon (``':'``) is missing before it.  File name and line number are printed "
"so you know where to look in case the input came from a script."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exceptions"
msgstr "Wyjątki"

msgid ""
"Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an "
"error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during "
"execution are called *exceptions* and are not unconditionally fatal: you "
"will soon learn how to handle them in Python programs.  Most exceptions are "
"not handled by programs, however, and result in error messages as shown "
"here::"
msgstr ""
"Nawet jeśli instrukcja lub wyrażenie jest poprawne składniowo, może ona "
"wywołać błąd podczas próby jej wykonania. Błędy zauważone podczas wykonania "
"programu są nazywane *wyjątkami* (exceptions) i nie zawsze są "
"niedopuszczalne: już niedługo nauczysz w jaki sposób je obsługiwać. "
"Większość wyjątków nie jest jednak obsługiwana przez program przez co "
"wyświetlane są informacje o błędzie jak pokazano poniżej::"

msgid ""
"The last line of the error message indicates what happened. Exceptions come "
"in different types, and the type is printed as part of the message: the "
"types in the example are :exc:`ZeroDivisionError`, :exc:`NameError` and :exc:"
"`TypeError`. The string printed as the exception type is the name of the "
"built-in exception that occurred.  This is true for all built-in exceptions, "
"but need not be true for user-defined exceptions (although it is a useful "
"convention). Standard exception names are built-in identifiers (not reserved "
"keywords)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The rest of the line provides detail based on the type of exception and what "
"caused it."
msgstr ""
"Pozostała część linii dostarcza szczegółów na temat typu wyjątku oraz "
"informacji, co go spowodowało."

msgid ""
"The preceding part of the error message shows the context where the "
"exception occurred, in the form of a stack traceback. In general it contains "
"a stack traceback listing source lines; however, it will not display lines "
"read from standard input."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`bltin-exceptions` lists the built-in exceptions and their meanings."
msgstr ":ref:`bltin-exceptions` wymienia wbudowane wyjątki i ich znaczenie."

msgid "Handling Exceptions"
msgstr "Obsługa wyjątków"

msgid ""
"It is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions. Look at "
"the following example, which asks the user for input until a valid integer "
"has been entered, but allows the user to interrupt the program (using :kbd:"
"`Control-C` or whatever the operating system supports); note that a user-"
"generated interruption is signalled by raising the :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` "
"exception. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The :keyword:`try` statement works as follows."
msgstr "Instrukcja :keyword:`try` działa następująco."

msgid ""
"First, the *try clause* (the statement(s) between the :keyword:`try` and :"
"keyword:`except` keywords) is executed."
msgstr ""
"W pierwszej kolejności wykonywane są instrukcje pod klauzulą *try* - "
"pomiędzy słowami kluczowymi :keyword:`try` i :keyword:`except`."

msgid ""
"If no exception occurs, the *except clause* is skipped and execution of the :"
"keyword:`try` statement is finished."
msgstr ""
"Jeżeli nie wystąpi żaden wyjątek, klauzula *except* jest pomijana i zostaje "
"zakończone wykonywanie instrukcji :keyword:`try`."

msgid ""
"If an exception occurs during execution of the :keyword:`try` clause, the "
"rest of the clause is skipped.  Then, if its type matches the exception "
"named after the :keyword:`except` keyword, the *except clause* is executed, "
"and then execution continues after the try/except block."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the "
"*except clause*, it is passed on to outer :keyword:`try` statements; if no "
"handler is found, it is an *unhandled exception* and execution stops with a "
"message as shown above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :keyword:`try` statement may have more than one *except clause*, to "
"specify handlers for different exceptions.  At most one handler will be "
"executed. Handlers only handle exceptions that occur in the corresponding "
"*try clause*, not in other handlers of the same :keyword:`!try` statement.  "
"An *except clause* may name multiple exceptions as a parenthesized tuple, "
"for example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A class in an :keyword:`except` clause is compatible with an exception if it "
"is the same class or a base class thereof (but not the other way around --- "
"an *except clause* listing a derived class is not compatible with a base "
"class). For example, the following code will print B, C, D in that order::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that if the *except clauses* were reversed (with ``except B`` first), "
"it would have printed B, B, B --- the first matching *except clause* is "
"triggered."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When an exception occurs, it may have associated values, also known as the "
"exception's *arguments*. The presence and types of the arguments depend on "
"the exception type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *except clause* may specify a variable after the exception name.  The "
"variable is bound to the exception instance which typically has an ``args`` "
"attribute that stores the arguments. For convenience, builtin exception "
"types define :meth:`__str__` to print all the arguments without explicitly "
"accessing ``.args``.  ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The exception's :meth:`__str__` output is printed as the last part "
"('detail') of the message for unhandled exceptions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":exc:`BaseException` is the common base class of all exceptions. One of its "
"subclasses, :exc:`Exception`, is the base class of all the non-fatal "
"exceptions. Exceptions which are not subclasses of :exc:`Exception` are not "
"typically handled, because they are used to indicate that the program should "
"terminate. They include :exc:`SystemExit` which is raised by :meth:`sys."
"exit` and :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` which is raised when a user wishes to "
"interrupt the program."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":exc:`Exception` can be used as a wildcard that catches (almost) everything. "
"However, it is good practice to be as specific as possible with the types of "
"exceptions that we intend to handle, and to allow any unexpected exceptions "
"to propagate on."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The most common pattern for handling :exc:`Exception` is to print or log the "
"exception and then re-raise it (allowing a caller to handle the exception as "
"well)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :keyword:`try` ... :keyword:`except` statement has an optional *else "
"clause*, which, when present, must follow all *except clauses*.  It is "
"useful for code that must be executed if the *try clause* does not raise an "
"exception. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The use of the :keyword:`!else` clause is better than adding additional code "
"to the :keyword:`try` clause because it avoids accidentally catching an "
"exception that wasn't raised by the code being protected by the :keyword:`!"
"try` ... :keyword:`!except` statement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exception handlers do not handle only exceptions that occur immediately in "
"the *try clause*, but also those that occur inside functions that are called "
"(even indirectly) in the *try clause*. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Raising Exceptions"
msgstr "Rzucanie wyjątków"

msgid ""
"The :keyword:`raise` statement allows the programmer to force a specified "
"exception to occur. For example::"
msgstr ""
"Instrukcja :keyword:`raise` pozwala programiście wymusić wystąpienie "
"żądanego wyjątku. Na przykład::"

msgid ""
"The sole argument to :keyword:`raise` indicates the exception to be raised. "
"This must be either an exception instance or an exception class (a class "
"that derives from :class:`BaseException`, such as :exc:`Exception` or one of "
"its subclasses).  If an exception class is passed, it will be implicitly "
"instantiated by calling its constructor with no arguments::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to determine whether an exception was raised but don't intend to "
"handle it, a simpler form of the :keyword:`raise` statement allows you to re-"
"raise the exception::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Exception Chaining"
msgstr "Łańcuch wyjątków"

msgid ""
"If an unhandled exception occurs inside an :keyword:`except` section, it "
"will have the exception being handled attached to it and included in the "
"error message::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To indicate that an exception is a direct consequence of another, the :"
"keyword:`raise` statement allows an optional :keyword:`from<raise>` clause::"
msgstr ""

msgid "This can be useful when you are transforming exceptions. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It also allows disabling automatic exception chaining using the ``from "
"None`` idiom::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For more information about chaining mechanics, see :ref:`bltin-exceptions`."
msgstr ""

msgid "User-defined Exceptions"
msgstr "Wyjątki zdefiniowane przez użytkownika"

msgid ""
"Programs may name their own exceptions by creating a new exception class "
"(see :ref:`tut-classes` for more about Python classes).  Exceptions should "
"typically be derived from the :exc:`Exception` class, either directly or "
"indirectly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exception classes can be defined which do anything any other class can do, "
"but are usually kept simple, often only offering a number of attributes that "
"allow information about the error to be extracted by handlers for the "
"exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most exceptions are defined with names that end in \"Error\", similar to the "
"naming of the standard exceptions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many standard modules define their own exceptions to report errors that may "
"occur in functions they define."
msgstr ""

msgid "Defining Clean-up Actions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :keyword:`try` statement has another optional clause which is intended "
"to define clean-up actions that must be executed under all circumstances.  "
"For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a :keyword:`finally` clause is present, the :keyword:`!finally` clause "
"will execute as the last task before the :keyword:`try` statement completes. "
"The :keyword:`!finally` clause runs whether or not the :keyword:`!try` "
"statement produces an exception. The following points discuss more complex "
"cases when an exception occurs:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an exception occurs during execution of the :keyword:`!try` clause, the "
"exception may be handled by an :keyword:`except` clause. If the exception is "
"not handled by an :keyword:`!except` clause, the exception is re-raised "
"after the :keyword:`!finally` clause has been executed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An exception could occur during execution of an :keyword:`!except` or :"
"keyword:`!else` clause. Again, the exception is re-raised after the :keyword:"
"`!finally` clause has been executed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the :keyword:`!finally` clause executes a :keyword:`break`, :keyword:"
"`continue` or :keyword:`return` statement, exceptions are not re-raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the :keyword:`!try` statement reaches a :keyword:`break`, :keyword:"
"`continue` or :keyword:`return` statement, the :keyword:`!finally` clause "
"will execute just prior to the :keyword:`!break`, :keyword:`!continue` or :"
"keyword:`!return` statement's execution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a :keyword:`!finally` clause includes a :keyword:`!return` statement, the "
"returned value will be the one from the :keyword:`!finally` clause's :"
"keyword:`!return` statement, not the value from the :keyword:`!try` "
"clause's :keyword:`!return` statement."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example::"
msgstr "Na przykład::"

msgid "A more complicated example::"
msgstr "Bardziej skomplikowany przykład::"

msgid ""
"As you can see, the :keyword:`finally` clause is executed in any event.  "
"The :exc:`TypeError` raised by dividing two strings is not handled by the :"
"keyword:`except` clause and therefore re-raised after the :keyword:`!"
"finally` clause has been executed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In real world applications, the :keyword:`finally` clause is useful for "
"releasing external resources (such as files or network connections), "
"regardless of whether the use of the resource was successful."
msgstr ""

msgid "Predefined Clean-up Actions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some objects define standard clean-up actions to be undertaken when the "
"object is no longer needed, regardless of whether or not the operation using "
"the object succeeded or failed. Look at the following example, which tries "
"to open a file and print its contents to the screen. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The problem with this code is that it leaves the file open for an "
"indeterminate amount of time after this part of the code has finished "
"executing. This is not an issue in simple scripts, but can be a problem for "
"larger applications. The :keyword:`with` statement allows objects like files "
"to be used in a way that ensures they are always cleaned up promptly and "
"correctly. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the statement is executed, the file *f* is always closed, even if a "
"problem was encountered while processing the lines. Objects which, like "
"files, provide predefined clean-up actions will indicate this in their "
"documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Raising and Handling Multiple Unrelated Exceptions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are situations where it is necessary to report several exceptions that "
"have occurred. This is often the case in concurrency frameworks, when "
"several tasks may have failed in parallel, but there are also other use "
"cases where it is desirable to continue execution and collect multiple "
"errors rather than raise the first exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The builtin :exc:`ExceptionGroup` wraps a list of exception instances so "
"that they can be raised together. It is an exception itself, so it can be "
"caught like any other exception. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By using ``except*`` instead of ``except``, we can selectively handle only "
"the exceptions in the group that match a certain type. In the following "
"example, which shows a nested exception group, each ``except*`` clause "
"extracts from the group exceptions of a certain type while letting all other "
"exceptions propagate to other clauses and eventually to be reraised. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the exceptions nested in an exception group must be instances, not "
"types. This is because in practice the exceptions would typically be ones "
"that have already been raised and caught by the program, along the following "
"pattern::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enriching Exceptions with Notes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When an exception is created in order to be raised, it is usually "
"initialized with information that describes the error that has occurred. "
"There are cases where it is useful to add information after the exception "
"was caught. For this purpose, exceptions have a method ``add_note(note)`` "
"that accepts a string and adds it to the exception's notes list. The "
"standard traceback rendering includes all notes, in the order they were "
"added, after the exception. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, when collecting exceptions into an exception group, we may want "
"to add context information for the individual errors. In the following each "
"exception in the group has a note indicating when this error has occurred. ::"
msgstr ""
