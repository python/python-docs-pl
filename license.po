"Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting "
"Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands as a "
"successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal "
"author, although it includes many contributions from others."

msgid ""
"In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National "
"Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us/) in Reston, "
"Virginia where he released several versions of the software."

"In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com "
"to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the "
"PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation; see "
"https://www.zope.org/).  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see "
"https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created "
"specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation "
"is a sponsoring member of the PSF."
