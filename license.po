"Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting "
"Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands as a "
"successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal "
"author, although it includes many contributions from others."

"In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National "

"   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n"
"\n"
"   \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\n"
"   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\n"
"   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n"

"       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n"
"       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n"

"5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n"
"   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n"
"   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n"

"   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n"
"   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n"
"   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n"

"   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n"
"   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n"
"   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n"
"   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n"
"   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n"
"\n"
"9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n"
"   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n"
"   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n"
"   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n"
