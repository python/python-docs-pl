msgid "PEP 634: Structural Pattern Matching"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Structural pattern matching has been added in the form of a *match "
"statement* and *case statements* of patterns with associated actions. "
"Patterns consist of sequences, mappings, primitive data types as well as "
"class instances. Pattern matching enables programs to extract information "
"from complex data types, branch on the structure of data, and apply specific "
"actions based on different forms of data."
msgstr ""

msgid "Syntax and operations"
msgstr ""

msgid "The generic syntax of pattern matching is::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A match statement takes an expression and compares its value to successive "
"patterns given as one or more case blocks.  Specifically, pattern matching "
"operates by:"
msgstr ""

msgid "using data with type and shape (the ``subject``)"
msgstr ""

msgid "evaluating the ``subject`` in the ``match`` statement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"comparing the subject with each pattern in a ``case`` statement from top to "
"bottom until a match is confirmed."
msgstr ""

msgid "executing the action associated with the pattern of the confirmed match"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an exact match is not confirmed, the last case, a wildcard ``_``, if "
"provided, will be used as the matching case. If an exact match is not "
"confirmed and a wildcard case does not exist, the entire match block is a no-"
"op."
msgstr ""

msgid "Declarative approach"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Readers may be aware of pattern matching through the simple example of "
"matching a subject (data object) to a literal (pattern) with the switch "
"statement found in C, Java or JavaScript (and many other languages). Often "
"the switch statement is used for comparison of an object/expression with "
"case statements containing literals."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"More powerful examples of pattern matching can be found in languages such as "
"Scala and Elixir. With structural pattern matching, the approach is "
"\"declarative\" and explicitly states the conditions (the patterns) for data "
"to match."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While an \"imperative\" series of instructions using nested \"if\" "
"statements could be used to accomplish something similar to structural "
"pattern matching, it is less clear than the \"declarative\" approach. "
"Instead the \"declarative\" approach states the conditions to meet for a "
"match and is more readable through its explicit patterns. While structural "
"pattern matching can be used in its simplest form comparing a variable to a "
"literal in a case statement, its true value for Python lies in its handling "
"of the subject's type and shape."
msgstr ""

msgid "Simple pattern: match to a literal"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's look at this example as pattern matching in its simplest form: a "
"value, the subject, being matched to several literals, the patterns. In the "
"example below, ``status`` is the subject of the match statement. The "
"patterns are each of the case statements, where literals represent request "
"status codes. The associated action to the case is executed after a match::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the above function is passed a ``status`` of 418, \"I'm a teapot\" is "
"returned. If the above function is passed a ``status`` of 500, the case "
"statement with ``_`` will match as a wildcard, and \"Something's wrong with "
"the internet\" is returned. Note the last block: the variable name, ``_``, "
"acts as a *wildcard* and insures the subject will always match. The use of "
"``_`` is optional."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can combine several literals in a single pattern using ``|`` (\"or\")::"
msgstr "Możesz łączyć kilka literałów w jeden wzorzec używając ``|`` („or”)::"

msgid "Behavior without the wildcard"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If we modify the above example by removing the last case block, the example "
"becomes::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Without the use of ``_`` in a case statement, a match may not exist. If no "
"match exists, the behavior is a no-op. For example, if ``status`` of 500 is "
"passed, a no-op occurs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Patterns with a literal and variable"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Patterns can look like unpacking assignments, and a pattern may be used to "
"bind variables. In this example, a data point can be unpacked to its x-"
"coordinate and y-coordinate::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first pattern has two literals, ``(0, 0)``, and may be thought of as an "
"extension of the literal pattern shown above. The next two patterns combine "
"a literal and a variable, and the variable *binds* a value from the subject "
"(``point``).  The fourth pattern captures two values, which makes it "
"conceptually similar to the unpacking assignment ``(x, y) = point``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Patterns and classes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are using classes to structure your data, you can use as a pattern "
"the class name followed by an argument list resembling a constructor. This "
"pattern has the ability to capture class attributes into variables::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Patterns with positional parameters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use positional parameters with some builtin classes that provide an "
"ordering for their attributes (e.g. dataclasses). You can also define a "
"specific position for attributes in patterns by setting the "
"``__match_args__`` special attribute in your classes. If it's set to (\"x\", "
"\"y\"), the following patterns are all equivalent (and all bind the ``y`` "
"attribute to the ``var`` variable)::"
msgstr ""
"Możesz użyć parametrów pozycyjnych z jakimiś wbudowanymi klasami, które "
"posiadają kolejność dla atrybutów (na przykład dataclasses). Możesz też "
"określić wybrane pozycje dla atrybutów we wzorcach ustawiając specjalny "
"atrybut ``__match_args__`` w twoich klasach. Jeśli jest on ustawiony na "
"(„x”, „y”), wszystkie następujące wzorce są równoważne (i wszystkie "
"powiązują atrybut ``y`` ze zmienną ``var``)::"

msgid "Nested patterns"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Patterns can be arbitrarily nested.  For example, if our data is a short "
"list of points, it could be matched like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Complex patterns and the wildcard"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To this point, the examples have used ``_`` alone in the last case "
"statement. A wildcard can be used in more complex patterns, such as "
"``('error', code, _)``. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the above case, ``test_variable`` will match for ('error', code, 100) and "
"('error', code, 800)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Guard"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can add an ``if`` clause to a pattern, known as a \"guard\".  If the "
"guard is false, ``match`` goes on to try the next case block.  Note that "
"value capture happens before the guard is evaluated::"
msgstr ""
"Możemy dodać klauzulę ``if`` do wzorca, nazywaną „guardem”. Jeśli guard jest "
"fałszywy, ``match`` próbuje dopasować następny blok case. Zwróć uwagę, że "
"przechwycenie wartości dzieje się zanim wyliczona jest wartość guarda::"

msgid "Other Key Features"
msgstr ""

msgid "Several other key features:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like unpacking assignments, tuple and list patterns have exactly the same "
"meaning and actually match arbitrary sequences. Technically, the subject "
"must be a sequence. Therefore, an important exception is that patterns don't "
"match iterators. Also, to prevent a common mistake, sequence patterns don't "
"match strings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sequence patterns support wildcards: ``[x, y, *rest]`` and ``(x, y, *rest)`` "
"work similar to wildcards in unpacking assignments.  The name after ``*`` "
"may also be ``_``, so ``(x, y, *_)`` matches a sequence of at least two "
"items without binding the remaining items."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mapping patterns: ``{\"bandwidth\": b, \"latency\": l}`` captures the "
"``\"bandwidth\"`` and ``\"latency\"`` values from a dict.  Unlike sequence "
"patterns, extra keys are ignored.  A wildcard ``**rest`` is also supported.  "
"(But ``**_`` would be redundant, so is not allowed.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Subpatterns may be captured using the ``as`` keyword::"
msgstr "Można przechwytywać podwzorce używając słowa kluczowego ``as``::"

msgid ""
"This binds x1, y1, x2, y2 like you would expect without the ``as`` clause, "
"and p2 to the entire second item of the subject."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most literals are compared by equality. However, the singletons ``True``, "
"``False`` and ``None`` are compared by identity."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Named constants may be used in patterns.  These named constants must be "
"dotted names to prevent the constant from being interpreted as a capture "
"variable::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the full specification see :pep:`634`.  Motivation and rationale are in :"
"pep:`635`, and a longer tutorial is in :pep:`636`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Optional ``EncodingWarning`` and ``encoding=\"locale\"`` option"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default encoding of :class:`TextIOWrapper` and :func:`open` is platform "
"and locale dependent. Since UTF-8 is used on most Unix platforms, omitting "
"``encoding`` option when opening UTF-8 files (e.g. JSON, YAML, TOML, "
"Markdown) is a very common bug. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To find this type of bug, an optional ``EncodingWarning`` is added. It is "
"emitted when :data:`sys.flags.warn_default_encoding <sys.flags>` is true and "
"locale-specific default encoding is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``-X warn_default_encoding`` option and :envvar:`PYTHONWARNDEFAULTENCODING` "
"are added to enable the warning."
msgstr ""

msgid "See :ref:`io-text-encoding` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "New Features Related to Type Hints"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This section covers major changes affecting :pep:`484` type hints and the :"
"mod:`typing` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "PEP 604: New Type Union Operator"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A new type union operator was introduced which enables the syntax ``X | Y``. "
"This provides a cleaner way of expressing 'either type X or type Y' instead "
"of using :data:`typing.Union`, especially in type hints."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In previous versions of Python, to apply a type hint for functions accepting "
"arguments of multiple types, :data:`typing.Union` was used::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Type hints can now be written in a more succinct manner::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This new syntax is also accepted as the second argument to :func:"
"`isinstance` and :func:`issubclass`::"

msgid "See :ref:`types-union` and :pep:`604` for more details."

msgid ""
"(Contributed by Maggie Moss and Philippe Prados in :issue:`41428`, with "
"additions by Yurii Karabas and Serhiy Storchaka in :issue:`44490`.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "PEP 612: Parameter Specification Variables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two new options to improve the information provided to static type checkers "
"for :pep:`484`\\ 's ``Callable`` have been added to the :mod:`typing` module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first is the parameter specification variable.  They are used to forward "
"the parameter types of one callable to another callable -- a pattern "
"commonly found in higher order functions and decorators.  Examples of usage "
"can be found in :class:`typing.ParamSpec`. Previously, there was no easy way "
"to type annotate dependency of parameter types in such a precise manner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second option is the new ``Concatenate`` operator. It's used in "
"conjunction with parameter specification variables to type annotate a higher "
"order callable which adds or removes parameters of another callable.  "
"Examples of usage can be found in :class:`typing.Concatenate`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See :class:`typing.Callable`, :class:`typing.ParamSpec`, :class:`typing."

msgid ""
"(Contributed by Ken Jin in :issue:`41559`, with minor enhancements by Jelle "
"Zijlstra in :issue:`43783`.  PEP written by Mark Mendoza.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "PEP 613: TypeAlias"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":pep:`484` introduced the concept of type aliases, only requiring them to be "
"top-level unannotated assignments. This simplicity sometimes made it "
"difficult for type checkers to distinguish between type aliases and ordinary "
"assignments, especially when forward references or invalid types were "
"involved. Compare::"
