":pep:`701` lifts some restrictions on the usage of :term:`f-strings <f-"

"uses single quotes). In Python 3.12, you can now do things like this:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that before this change there was no explicit limit in how f-strings "
"can be nested, but the fact that string quotes cannot be reused inside the "
"expression component of f-strings made it impossible to nest f-strings "
"arbitrarily. In fact, this is the most nested f-string that could be written:"

msgid ""
"As now f-strings can contain any valid Python expression inside expression "
"components, it is now possible to nest f-strings arbitrarily:"

"Multi-line expressions and comments: In Python 3.11, f-string expressions "
"must be defined in a single line, even if the expression within the f-string "
"could normally span multiple lines (like literal lists being defined over "
"multiple lines), making them harder to read. In Python 3.12 you can now "
"define f-strings spanning multiple lines, and add inline comments:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Backslashes and unicode characters: before Python 3.12 f-string expressions "

"As a positive side-effect of how this feature has been implemented (by "

"f-strings are more precise and include the exact location of the error. For "
"example, in Python 3.11, the following f-string raises a :exc:`SyntaxError`:"
