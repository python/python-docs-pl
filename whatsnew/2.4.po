msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python 2.4 is a medium-sized release.  It doesn't introduce as many changes "
"as the radical Python 2.2, but introduces more features than the "
"conservative 2.3 release.  The most significant new language features are "
"function decorators and generator expressions; most other changes are to the "
"standard library."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"According to the CVS change logs, there were 481 patches applied and 502 "
"bugs fixed between Python 2.3 and 2.4.  Both figures are likely to be "
"underestimates."

msgid ""
"This article doesn't attempt to provide a complete specification of every "
"single new feature, but instead provides a brief introduction to each "
"feature.  For full details, you should refer to the documentation for Python "
"2.4, such as the Python Library Reference and the Python Reference Manual.  "
"Often you will be referred to the PEP for a particular new feature for "
"explanations of the implementation and design rationale."

msgid "PEP 218: Built-In Set Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python 2.3 introduced the :mod:`sets` module.  C implementations of set data "
"types have now been added to the Python core as two new built-in types, "
"``set(iterable)`` and ``frozenset(iterable)``.  They provide high speed "
"operations for membership testing, for eliminating duplicates from "
"sequences, and for mathematical operations like unions, intersections, "
"differences, and symmetric differences. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`frozenset` type is an immutable version of :func:`set`. Since it "
"is immutable and hashable, it may be used as a dictionary key or as a member "
"of another set."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`sets` module remains in the standard library, and may be useful if "
"you wish to subclass the :class:`Set` or :class:`ImmutableSet` classes.  "
"There are currently no plans to deprecate the module."

msgid "PEP 237: Unifying Long Integers and Integers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The lengthy transition process for this PEP, begun in Python 2.2, takes "
"another step forward in Python 2.4.  In 2.3, certain integer operations that "
"would behave differently after int/long unification triggered :exc:"
"`FutureWarning` warnings and returned values limited to 32 or 64 bits "
"(depending on your platform).  In 2.4, these expressions no longer produce a "
"warning and instead produce a different result that's usually a long integer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The problematic expressions are primarily left shifts and lengthy "
"hexadecimal and octal constants.  For example, ``2 << 32`` results in a "
"warning in 2.3, evaluating to 0 on 32-bit platforms.  In Python 2.4, this "
"expression now returns the correct answer, 8589934592."

msgstr ""

msgid "PEP 289: Generator Expressions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The iterator feature introduced in Python 2.2 and the :mod:`itertools` "
"module make it easier to write programs that loop through large data sets "
"without having the entire data set in memory at one time.  List "
"comprehensions don't fit into this picture very well because they produce a "
"Python list object containing all of the items.  This unavoidably pulls all "
"of the objects into memory, which can be a problem if your data set is very "
"large.  When trying to write a functionally styled program, it would be "
"natural to write something like::"
msgstr ""

msgid "instead of  ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first form is more concise and perhaps more readable, but if you're "
"dealing with a large number of link objects you'd have to write the second "
"form to avoid having all link objects in memory at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generator expressions work similarly to list comprehensions but don't "
"materialize the entire list; instead they create a generator that will "
"return elements one by one.  The above example could be written as::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generator expressions always have to be written inside parentheses, as in "
"the above example.  The parentheses signalling a function call also count, "
"so if you want to create an iterator that will be immediately passed to a "
"function you could write::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generator expressions differ from list comprehensions in various small ways. "
"Most notably, the loop variable (*obj* in the above example) is not "
"accessible outside of the generator expression.  List comprehensions leave "
"the variable assigned to its last value; future versions of Python will "
"change this, making list comprehensions match generator expressions in this "
"respect."

msgid "PEP 292: Simpler String Substitutions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some new classes in the standard library provide an alternative mechanism "
"for substituting variables into strings; this style of substitution may be "
"better for applications where untrained users need to edit templates."
msgstr ""

msgid "The usual way of substituting variables by name is the ``%`` operator::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When writing the template string, it can be easy to forget the ``i`` or "
"``s`` after the closing parenthesis.  This isn't a big problem if the "
"template is in a Python module, because you run the code, get an "
"\"Unsupported format character\" :exc:`ValueError`, and fix the problem.  "
"However, consider an application such as Mailman where template strings or "
"translations are being edited by users who aren't aware of the Python "
"language.  The format string's syntax is complicated to explain to such "
"users, and if they make a mistake, it's difficult to provide helpful "
"feedback to them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"PEP 292 adds a :class:`Template` class to the :mod:`string` module that uses "
"``$`` to indicate a substitution::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a key is missing from the dictionary, the :meth:`substitute` method will "
"raise a :exc:`KeyError`.  There's also a :meth:`safe_substitute` method that "

msgid "Written and implemented  by Barry Warsaw."

msgid "PEP 318: Decorators for Functions and Methods"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python 2.2 extended Python's object model by adding static methods and class "
"methods, but it didn't extend Python's syntax to provide any new way of "
"defining static or class methods.  Instead, you had to write a :keyword:"
"`def` statement in the usual way, and pass the resulting method to a :func:"
"`staticmethod` or :func:`classmethod` function that would wrap up the "
"function as a method of the new type. Your code would look like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the method was very long, it would be easy to miss or forget the :func:"
"`classmethod` invocation after the function body."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The intention was always to add some syntax to make such definitions more "
"readable, but at the time of 2.2's release a good syntax was not obvious.  "
"Today a good syntax *still* isn't obvious but users are asking for easier "
"access to the feature; a new syntactic feature has been added to meet this "
"need."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The new feature is called \"function decorators\".  The name comes from the "
"idea that :func:`classmethod`, :func:`staticmethod`, and friends are storing "
"additional information on a function object; they're *decorating* functions "
"with more details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The notation borrows from Java and uses the ``'@'`` character as an "
"indicator. Using the new syntax, the example above would be written::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``@classmethod`` is shorthand for the ``meth=classmethod(meth)`` "
"assignment. More generally, if you have the following::"
msgstr ""

msgid "It's equivalent to the following pre-decorator code::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Decorators must come on the line before a function definition, one decorator "
"per line, and can't be on the same line as the def statement, meaning that "
"``@A def f(): ...`` is illegal.  You can only decorate function definitions, "
"either at the module level or inside a class; you can't decorate class "
"definitions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A decorator is just a function that takes the function to be decorated as an "
"argument and returns either the same function or some new object.  The "
"return value of the decorator need not be callable (though it typically is), "
"unless further decorators will be applied to the result.  It's easy to write "
"your own decorators.  The following simple example just sets an attribute on "
"the function object::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a slightly more realistic example, the following decorator checks that "
"the supplied argument is an integer::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An example in :pep:`318` contains a fancier version of this idea that lets "
"you both specify the required type and check the returned type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Decorator functions can take arguments.  If arguments are supplied, your "
"decorator function is called with only those arguments and must return a new "
"decorator function; this function must take a single function and return a "
"function, as previously described.  In other words, ``@A @B @C(args)`` "
"becomes::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Getting this right can be slightly brain-bending, but it's not too difficult."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A small related change makes the :attr:`func_name` attribute of functions "
"writable.  This attribute is used to display function names in tracebacks, "
"so decorators should change the name of any new function that's constructed "
"and returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ":pep:`318` - Decorators for Functions, Methods and Classes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Written  by Kevin D. Smith, Jim Jewett, and Skip Montanaro.  Several people "
"wrote patches implementing function decorators, but the one that was "
"actually checked in was patch #979728, written by Mark Russell."

"A new built-in function, ``reversed(seq)``, takes a sequence and returns an "
"iterator that loops over the elements of the sequence  in reverse order.   ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Compared to extended slicing, such as ``range(1,4)[::-1]``, :func:`reversed` "
"is easier to read, runs faster, and uses substantially less memory."

msgid "PEP 324: New subprocess Module"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The standard library provides a number of ways to execute a subprocess, "
"offering different features and different levels of complexity. ``os."
"system(command)`` is easy to use, but slow (it runs a shell process which "
"executes the command) and dangerous (you have to be careful about escaping "
"the shell's metacharacters).  The :mod:`popen2` module offers classes that "
"can capture standard output and standard error from the subprocess, but the "
"naming is confusing.  The :mod:`subprocess` module cleans  this up, "
"providing a unified interface that offers all the features you might need."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead of :mod:`popen2`'s collection of classes, :mod:`subprocess` contains "
"a single class called :class:`Popen`  whose constructor supports a number of "
"different keyword arguments. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*args* is commonly a sequence of strings that will be the arguments to the "
"program executed as the subprocess.  (If the *shell* argument is true, "
"*args* can be a string which will then be passed on to the shell for "
"interpretation, just as :func:`os.system` does.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*stdin*, *stdout*, and *stderr* specify what the subprocess's input, output, "
"and error streams will be.  You can provide a file object or a file "
"descriptor, or you can use the constant ``subprocess.PIPE`` to create a pipe "
"between the subprocess and the parent."
msgstr ""

msgid "The constructor has a number of handy options:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*close_fds* requests that all file descriptors be closed before running the "

"*cwd* specifies the working directory in which the subprocess will be "
"executed (defaulting to whatever the parent's working directory is)."
msgstr ""

msgid "*env* is a dictionary specifying environment variables."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*preexec_fn* is a function that gets called before the child is started."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*universal_newlines* opens the child's input and output using Python's :term:"
"`universal newlines` feature."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you've created the :class:`Popen` instance,  you can call its :meth:"
"`wait` method to pause until the subprocess has exited, :meth:`poll` to "
"check if it's exited without pausing,  or ``communicate(data)`` to send the "
"string *data* to the subprocess's standard input.   ``communicate(data)``  "
"then reads any data that the subprocess has sent to its standard output  or "
"standard error, returning a tuple ``(stdout_data, stderr_data)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`call` is a shortcut that passes its arguments along to the :class:"

"status code of the subprocess.  It can serve as a safer analog to :func:`os."

msgid ""
"The command is invoked without use of the shell.  If you really do want to  "

msgid "PEP 327: Decimal Data Type"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python has always supported floating-point (FP) numbers, based on the "
"underlying C :c:expr:`double` type, as a data type.  However, while most "
"programming languages provide a floating-point type, many people (even "
"programmers) are unaware that floating-point numbers don't represent certain "
"decimal fractions accurately.  The new :class:`Decimal` type can represent "
"these fractions accurately, up to a user-specified precision limit."
msgstr ""

msgid "Why is Decimal needed?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The limitations arise from the representation used for floating-point "
"numbers. FP numbers are made up of three components:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The sign, which is positive or negative."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The mantissa, which is a single-digit binary number   followed by a "
"fractional part.  For example, ``1.01`` in base-2 notation is ``1 + 0/2 + "
"1/4``, or 1.25 in decimal notation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The exponent, which tells where the decimal point is located in the number "
"represented."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the number 1.25 has positive sign, a mantissa value of 1.01 (in "
"binary), and an exponent of 0 (the decimal point doesn't need to be "
"shifted). The number 5 has the same sign and mantissa, but the exponent is 2 "
"because the mantissa is multiplied by 4 (2 to the power of the exponent 2); "
"1.25 \\* 4 equals 5."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Modern systems usually provide floating-point support that conforms to a "
"standard called IEEE 754.  C's :c:expr:`double` type is usually implemented "
"as a 64-bit IEEE 754 number, which uses 52 bits of space for the mantissa.  "
"This means that numbers can only be specified to 52 bits of precision.  If "
"you're trying to represent numbers whose expansion repeats endlessly, the "
"expansion is cut off after 52 bits. Unfortunately, most software needs to "
"produce output in base 10, and common fractions in base 10 are often "
"repeating decimals in binary. For example, 1.1 decimal is binary "
"``1.0001100110011 ...``; .1 = 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/256 plus an infinite number of "
"additional terms.  IEEE 754 has to chop off that infinitely repeated decimal "
"after 52 digits, so the representation is slightly inaccurate."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sometimes you can see this inaccuracy when the number is printed::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The inaccuracy isn't always visible when you print the number because the FP-"
"to-decimal-string conversion is provided by the C library, and most C "
"libraries try to produce sensible output.  Even if it's not displayed, "
"however, the inaccuracy is still there and subsequent operations can magnify "
"the error."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For many applications this doesn't matter.  If I'm plotting points and "
"displaying them on my monitor, the difference between 1.1 and "
"1.1000000000000001 is too small to be visible.  Reports often limit output "
"to a certain number of decimal places, and if you round the number to two or "
"three or even eight decimal places, the error is never apparent.  However, "
"for applications where it does matter,  it's a lot of work to implement your "
"own custom arithmetic routines."
msgstr ""

msgid "Hence, the :class:`Decimal` type was created."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :class:`Decimal` type"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A new module, :mod:`decimal`, was added to Python's standard library.  It "
"contains two classes, :class:`Decimal` and :class:`Context`.  :class:"
"`Decimal` instances represent numbers, and :class:`Context` instances are "
"used to wrap up various settings such as the precision and default rounding "
"mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`Decimal` instances are immutable, like regular Python integers and "
"FP numbers; once it's been created, you can't change the value an instance "
"represents.  :class:`Decimal` instances can be created from integers or "
"strings::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also provide tuples containing the sign, the mantissa represented  "
"as a tuple of decimal digits, and the exponent::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Cautionary note: the sign bit is a Boolean value, so 0 is positive and 1 is "
"negative."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Converting from floating-point numbers poses a bit of a problem: should the "
"FP number representing 1.1 turn into the decimal number for exactly 1.1, or "
"for 1.1 plus whatever inaccuracies are introduced? The decision was to dodge "
"the issue and leave such a conversion out of the API.  Instead, you should "
"convert the floating-point number into a string using the desired precision "
"and pass the string to the :class:`Decimal` constructor::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you have :class:`Decimal` instances, you can perform the usual "
"mathematical operations on them.  One limitation: exponentiation requires an "
"integer exponent::"

msgid ""
"You can combine :class:`Decimal` instances with integers, but not with "
"floating-point numbers::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`Decimal` numbers can be used with the :mod:`math` and :mod:`cmath` "
"modules, but note that they'll be immediately converted to  floating-point "
"numbers before the operation is performed, resulting in a possible loss of "
"precision and accuracy.  You'll also get back a regular floating-point "
"number and not a :class:`Decimal`.   ::"

msgid ""
":attr:`traps` is a dictionary specifying what happens on encountering "

"The :mod:`locale` modules lets Python software select various conversions "

"Python can now be built with additional profiling for the interpreter "
"itself, intended as an aid to people developing the Python core.  Providing :"
"option:`!--enable-profiling` to the :program:`configure` script will let you "
"profile the interpreter with :program:`gprof`, and providing the :option:`!--"
"with-tsc` switch enables profiling using the Pentium's Time-Stamp-Counter "
"register.  Note that the :option:`!--with-tsc` switch is slightly misnamed, "
"because the profiling feature also works on the PowerPC platform, though "
"that processor architecture doesn't call that register \"the TSC "
"register\".  (Contributed by Jeremy Hylton.)"
