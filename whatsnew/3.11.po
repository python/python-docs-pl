msgid "PEP 646: Variadic generics"

msgid ""
":pep:`484` previously introduced :data:`~typing.TypeVar`, enabling creation "
"of generics parameterised with a single type. :pep:`646` adds :data:`~typing."
"TypeVarTuple`, enabling parameterisation with an *arbitrary* number of "

"variable, enabling *variadic* generics."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This enables a wide variety of use cases. In particular, it allows the type "
"of array-like structures in numerical computing libraries such as NumPy and "
"TensorFlow to be parameterised with the array *shape*. Static type checkers "

msgid "PEP 673: ``Self`` type"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The new :data:`~typing.Self` annotation provides a simple and intuitive way "
"to annotate methods that return an instance of their class. This behaves the "
"same as the :class:`~typing.TypeVar`-based approach :pep:`specified in PEP "
"484 <484#annotating-instance-and-class-methods>`, but is more concise and "

msgid ""
"The new :data:`~typing.LiteralString` annotation may be used to indicate "
"that a function parameter can be of any literal string type. This allows a "
"function to accept arbitrary literal string types, as well as strings "
"created from other literal strings. Type checkers can then enforce that "
"sensitive functions, such as those that execute SQL statements or shell "
"commands, are called only with static arguments, providing protection "

":data:`~typing.dataclass_transform` may be used to decorate a class, "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
":pep:`659` is one of the key parts of the Faster CPython project. The "
"general idea is that while Python is a dynamic language, most code has "
"regions where objects and types rarely change. This concept is known as "
"*type stability*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At runtime, Python will try to look for common patterns and type stability "
"in the executing code. Python will then replace the current operation with a "
"more specialized one. This specialized operation uses fast paths available "
"only to those use cases/types, which generally outperform their generic "
"counterparts. This also brings in another concept called *inline caching*, "
"where Python caches the results of expensive operations directly in the :"
"term:`bytecode`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The specializer will also combine certain common instruction pairs into one "
"superinstruction, reducing the overhead during execution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python will only specialize when it sees code that is \"hot\" (executed "
"multiple times). This prevents Python from wasting time on run-once code. "
"Python can also de-specialize when code is too dynamic or when the use "
"changes. Specialization is attempted periodically, and specialization "
"attempts are not too expensive, allowing specialization to adapt to new "
"circumstances."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Write Pythonic code that follows common best practices; you don't have to "
"change your code. The Faster CPython project optimizes for common code "
"patterns we observe."
msgstr ""

msgid "Will CPython 3.11 use more memory?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Maybe not; we don't expect memory use to exceed 20% higher than 3.10. This "
"is offset by memory optimizations for frame objects and object dictionaries "
"as mentioned above."
msgstr ""

msgid "I don't see any speedups in my workload. Why?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Certain code won't have noticeable benefits. If your code spends most of its "
"time on I/O operations, or already does most of its computation in a C "
"extension library like NumPy, there won't be significant speedups. This "
"project currently benefits pure-Python workloads the most."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Furthermore, the pyperformance figures are a geometric mean. Even within the "
"pyperformance benchmarks, certain benchmarks have slowed down slightly, "
"while others have sped up by nearly 2x!"
