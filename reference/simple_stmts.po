msgid ""
"A simple statement is comprised within a single logical line. Several simple "
"statements may occur on a single line separated by semicolons.  The syntax "
"for simple statements is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Expression statements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Expression statements are used (mostly interactively) to compute and write a "
"value, or (usually) to call a procedure (a function that returns no "
"meaningful result; in Python, procedures return the value ``None``).  Other "
"uses of expression statements are allowed and occasionally useful.  The "
"syntax for an expression statement is:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An expression statement evaluates the expression list (which may be a single "
"expression)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In interactive mode, if the value is not ``None``, it is converted to a "
"string using the built-in :func:`repr` function and the resulting string is "
"written to standard output on a line by itself (except if the result is "
"``None``, so that procedure calls do not cause any output.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Assignment statements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assignment statements are used to (re)bind names to values and to modify "
"attributes or items of mutable objects:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"(See section :ref:`primaries` for the syntax definitions for *attributeref*, "
"*subscription*, and *slicing*.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An assignment statement evaluates the expression list (remember that this "
"can be a single expression or a comma-separated list, the latter yielding a "
"tuple) and assigns the single resulting object to each of the target lists, "
"from left to right."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assignment is defined recursively depending on the form of the target "
"(list). When a target is part of a mutable object (an attribute reference, "
"subscription or slicing), the mutable object must ultimately perform the "
"assignment and decide about its validity, and may raise an exception if the "
"assignment is unacceptable.  The rules observed by various types and the "
"exceptions raised are given with the definition of the object types (see "
"section :ref:`types`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assignment of an object to a target list, optionally enclosed in parentheses "
"or square brackets, is recursively defined as follows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the target list is a single target with no trailing comma, optionally in "
"parentheses, the object is assigned to that target."
msgstr ""

msgid "Else:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the target list contains one target prefixed with an asterisk, called a "
"\"starred\" target: The object must be an iterable with at least as many "
"items as there are targets in the target list, minus one.  The first items "
"of the iterable are assigned, from left to right, to the targets before the "
"starred target.  The final items of the iterable are assigned to the targets "
"after the starred target.  A list of the remaining items in the iterable is "
"then assigned to the starred target (the list can be empty)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Else: The object must be an iterable with the same number of items as there "
"are targets in the target list, and the items are assigned, from left to "
"right, to the corresponding targets."

msgid ""
"Assignment of an object to a single target is recursively defined as follows."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the target is an identifier (name):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the name does not occur in a :keyword:`global` or :keyword:`nonlocal` "
"statement in the current code block: the name is bound to the object in the "
"current local namespace."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Otherwise: the name is bound to the object in the global namespace or the "
"outer namespace determined by :keyword:`nonlocal`, respectively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The name is rebound if it was already bound.  This may cause the reference "
"count for the object previously bound to the name to reach zero, causing the "
"object to be deallocated and its destructor (if it has one) to be called."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the target is an attribute reference: The primary expression in the "
"reference is evaluated.  It should yield an object with assignable "
"attributes; if this is not the case, :exc:`TypeError` is raised.  That "
"object is then asked to assign the assigned object to the given attribute; "
"if it cannot perform the assignment, it raises an exception (usually but not "
"necessarily :exc:`AttributeError`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note: If the object is a class instance and the attribute reference occurs "
"on both sides of the assignment operator, the right-hand side expression, "
"``a.x`` can access either an instance attribute or (if no instance attribute "
"exists) a class attribute.  The left-hand side target ``a.x`` is always set "
"as an instance attribute, creating it if necessary.  Thus, the two "
"occurrences of ``a.x`` do not necessarily refer to the same attribute: if "
"the right-hand side expression refers to a class attribute, the left-hand "
"side creates a new instance attribute as the target of the assignment::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This description does not necessarily apply to descriptor attributes, such "
"as properties created with :func:`property`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the target is a subscription: The primary expression in the reference is "
"evaluated.  It should yield either a mutable sequence object (such as a "
"list) or a mapping object (such as a dictionary).  Next, the subscript "
"expression is evaluated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the primary is a mutable sequence object (such as a list), the subscript "
"must yield an integer.  If it is negative, the sequence's length is added to "
"it.  The resulting value must be a nonnegative integer less than the "
"sequence's length, and the sequence is asked to assign the assigned object "
"to its item with that index.  If the index is out of range, :exc:"
"`IndexError` is raised (assignment to a subscripted sequence cannot add new "
"items to a list)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the primary is a mapping object (such as a dictionary), the subscript "
"must have a type compatible with the mapping's key type, and the mapping is "
"then asked to create a key/datum pair which maps the subscript to the "
"assigned object.  This can either replace an existing key/value pair with "
"the same key value, or insert a new key/value pair (if no key with the same "
"value existed)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For user-defined objects, the :meth:`__setitem__` method is called with "
"appropriate arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the target is a slicing: The primary expression in the reference is "
"evaluated.  It should yield a mutable sequence object (such as a list).  The "
"assigned object should be a sequence object of the same type.  Next, the "
"lower and upper bound expressions are evaluated, insofar they are present; "
"defaults are zero and the sequence's length.  The bounds should evaluate to "
"integers. If either bound is negative, the sequence's length is added to "
"it.  The resulting bounds are clipped to lie between zero and the sequence's "
"length, inclusive.  Finally, the sequence object is asked to replace the "
"slice with the items of the assigned sequence.  The length of the slice may "
"be different from the length of the assigned sequence, thus changing the "
"length of the target sequence, if the target sequence allows it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the current implementation, the syntax for targets is taken to be the "
"same as for expressions, and invalid syntax is rejected during the code "
"generation phase, causing less detailed error messages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although the definition of assignment implies that overlaps between the left-"
"hand side and the right-hand side are 'simultaneous' (for example ``a, b = "
"b, a`` swaps two variables), overlaps *within* the collection of assigned-to "
"variables occur left-to-right, sometimes resulting in confusion.  For "
"instance, the following program prints ``[0, 2]``::"

msgid "Augmented assignment statements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Augmented assignment is the combination, in a single statement, of a binary "
"operation and an assignment statement:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"(See section :ref:`primaries` for the syntax definitions of the last three "
"symbols.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An augmented assignment evaluates the target (which, unlike normal "
"assignment statements, cannot be an unpacking) and the expression list, "
"performs the binary operation specific to the type of assignment on the two "
"operands, and assigns the result to the original target.  The target is only "
"evaluated once."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An augmented assignment expression like ``x += 1`` can be rewritten as ``x = "
"x + 1`` to achieve a similar, but not exactly equal effect. In the augmented "
"version, ``x`` is only evaluated once. Also, when possible, the actual "
"operation is performed *in-place*, meaning that rather than creating a new "
"object and assigning that to the target, the old object is modified instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike normal assignments, augmented assignments evaluate the left-hand side "
"*before* evaluating the right-hand side.  For example, ``a[i] += f(x)`` "
"first looks-up ``a[i]``, then it evaluates ``f(x)`` and performs the "
"addition, and lastly, it writes the result back to ``a[i]``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the exception of assigning to tuples and multiple targets in a single "
"statement, the assignment done by augmented assignment statements is handled "
"the same way as normal assignments. Similarly, with the exception of the "
"possible *in-place* behavior, the binary operation performed by augmented "
"assignment is the same as the normal binary operations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For targets which are attribute references, the same :ref:`caveat about "
"class and instance attributes <attr-target-note>` applies as for regular "
"assignments."
msgstr ""

msgid "Annotated assignment statements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":term:`Annotation <variable annotation>` assignment is the combination, in a "
"single statement, of a variable or attribute annotation and an optional "
"assignment statement:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The difference from normal :ref:`assignment` is that only a single target is "
"allowed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For simple names as assignment targets, if in class or module scope, the "
"annotations are evaluated and stored in a special class or module attribute :"
"attr:`__annotations__` that is a dictionary mapping from variable names "
"(mangled if private) to evaluated annotations. This attribute is writable "
"and is automatically created at the start of class or module body execution, "
"if annotations are found statically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For expressions as assignment targets, the annotations are evaluated if in "
"class or module scope, but not stored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a name is annotated in a function scope, then this name is local for that "
"scope. Annotations are never evaluated and stored in function scopes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the right hand side is present, an annotated assignment performs the "
"actual assignment before evaluating annotations (where applicable). If the "
"right hand side is not present for an expression target, then the "
"interpreter evaluates the target except for the last :meth:`__setitem__` or :"
"meth:`__setattr__` call."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The proposal that added the :mod:`typing` module to provide a standard "
"syntax for type annotations that can be used in static analysis tools and "
"IDEs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Now annotated assignments allow the same expressions in the right hand side "

msgid ""
"The extended form, ``assert expression1, expression2``, is equivalent to ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These equivalences assume that :const:`__debug__` and :exc:`AssertionError` "
"refer to the built-in variables with those names.  In the current "
"implementation, the built-in variable :const:`__debug__` is ``True`` under "
"normal circumstances, ``False`` when optimization is requested (command line "
"option :option:`-O`).  The current code generator emits no code for an "
"assert statement when optimization is requested at compile time.  Note that "
"it is unnecessary to include the source code for the expression that failed "
"in the error message; it will be displayed as part of the stack trace."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assignments to :const:`__debug__` are illegal.  The value for the built-in "

msgstr ""

msgid "The :keyword:`!pass` statement"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":keyword:`pass` is a null operation --- when it is executed, nothing "

"`NameError` exception will be raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Deletion of attribute references, subscriptions and slicings is passed to "
"the primary object involved; deletion of a slicing is in general equivalent "
"to assignment of an empty slice of the right type (but even this is "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Previously it was illegal to delete a name from the local namespace if it "

":keyword:`return` may only occur syntactically nested in a function "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an expression list is present, it is evaluated, else ``None`` is "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :keyword:`yield` statement is semantically equivalent to a :ref:`yield "

msgid ""
"Yield expressions and statements are only used when defining a :term:"

"A future statement is recognized and treated specially at compile time: "
"Changes to the semantics of core constructs are often implemented by "

"case the compiler may need to parse the module differently.  Such decisions "
"cannot be pushed off until runtime."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :keyword:`global` statement is a declaration which holds for the entire "

"string or code object supplied to the built-in :func:`exec` function does "
"not affect the code block *containing* the function call, and code contained "
