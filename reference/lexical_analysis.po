msgid "Lexical analysis"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Python program is read by a *parser*.  Input to the parser is a stream of "
"*tokens*, generated by the *lexical analyzer*.  This chapter describes how "
"the lexical analyzer breaks a file into tokens."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python reads program text as Unicode code points; the encoding of a source "
"file can be given by an encoding declaration and defaults to UTF-8, see :pep:"
"`3120` for details.  If the source file cannot be decoded, a :exc:"
"`SyntaxError` is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid "Line structure"
msgstr ""

msgid "A Python program is divided into a number of *logical lines*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Logical lines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The end of a logical line is represented by the token NEWLINE.  Statements "
"cannot cross logical line boundaries except where NEWLINE is allowed by the "
"syntax (e.g., between statements in compound statements). A logical line is "
"constructed from one or more *physical lines* by following the explicit or "
"implicit *line joining* rules."
msgstr ""

msgid "Physical lines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A physical line is a sequence of characters terminated by an end-of-line "
"sequence.  In source files and strings, any of the standard platform line "
"termination sequences can be used - the Unix form using ASCII LF (linefeed), "
"the Windows form using the ASCII sequence CR LF (return followed by "
"linefeed), or the old Macintosh form using the ASCII CR (return) character.  "
"All of these forms can be used equally, regardless of platform. The end of "
"input also serves as an implicit terminator for the final physical line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When embedding Python, source code strings should be passed to Python APIs "
"using the standard C conventions for newline characters (the ``\\n`` "
"character, representing ASCII LF, is the line terminator)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Comments"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A comment starts with a hash character (``#``) that is not part of a string "
"literal, and ends at the end of the physical line.  A comment signifies the "
"end of the logical line unless the implicit line joining rules are invoked. "
"Comments are ignored by the syntax."
msgstr ""

msgid "Encoding declarations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a comment in the first or second line of the Python script matches the "
"regular expression ``coding[=:]\\s*([-\\w.]+)``, this comment is processed "
"as an encoding declaration; the first group of this expression names the "
"encoding of the source code file. The encoding declaration must appear on a "
"line of its own. If it is the second line, the first line must also be a "
"comment-only line. The recommended forms of an encoding expression are ::"
msgstr ""

msgid "which is recognized also by GNU Emacs, and ::"
msgstr ""

msgid "which is recognized by Bram Moolenaar's VIM."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If no encoding declaration is found, the default encoding is UTF-8.  In "
"addition, if the first bytes of the file are the UTF-8 byte-order mark "
"(``b'\\xef\\xbb\\xbf'``), the declared file encoding is UTF-8 (this is "
"supported, among others, by Microsoft's :program:`notepad`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an encoding is declared, the encoding name must be recognized by Python "
"(see :ref:`standard-encodings`). The encoding is used for all lexical "
"analysis, including string literals, comments and identifiers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Explicit line joining"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two or more physical lines may be joined into logical lines using backslash "
"characters (``\\``), as follows: when a physical line ends in a backslash "
"that is not part of a string literal or comment, it is joined with the "
"following forming a single logical line, deleting the backslash and the "
"following end-of-line character.  For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A line ending in a backslash cannot carry a comment.  A backslash does not "
"continue a comment.  A backslash does not continue a token except for string "
"literals (i.e., tokens other than string literals cannot be split across "
"physical lines using a backslash).  A backslash is illegal elsewhere on a "
"line outside a string literal."
msgstr ""

msgid "Implicit line joining"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Expressions in parentheses, square brackets or curly braces can be split "
"over more than one physical line without using backslashes. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Implicitly continued lines can carry comments.  The indentation of the "
"continuation lines is not important.  Blank continuation lines are allowed. "
"There is no NEWLINE token between implicit continuation lines.  Implicitly "
"continued lines can also occur within triple-quoted strings (see below); in "
"that case they cannot carry comments."
msgstr ""

msgid "Blank lines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A logical line that contains only spaces, tabs, formfeeds and possibly a "
"comment, is ignored (i.e., no NEWLINE token is generated).  During "
"interactive input of statements, handling of a blank line may differ "
"depending on the implementation of the read-eval-print loop.  In the "
"standard interactive interpreter, an entirely blank logical line (i.e. one "
"containing not even whitespace or a comment) terminates a multi-line "
"statement."
msgstr ""

msgid "Indentation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of a logical line is "
"used to compute the indentation level of the line, which in turn is used to "
"determine the grouping of statements."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tabs are replaced (from left to right) by one to eight spaces such that the "
"total number of characters up to and including the replacement is a multiple "
"of eight (this is intended to be the same rule as used by Unix).  The total "
"number of spaces preceding the first non-blank character then determines the "
"line's indentation.  Indentation cannot be split over multiple physical "
"lines using backslashes; the whitespace up to the first backslash determines "
"the indentation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Indentation is rejected as inconsistent if a source file mixes tabs and "
"spaces in a way that makes the meaning dependent on the worth of a tab in "
"spaces; a :exc:`TabError` is raised in that case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Cross-platform compatibility note:** because of the nature of text editors "
"on non-UNIX platforms, it is unwise to use a mixture of spaces and tabs for "
"the indentation in a single source file.  It should also be noted that "
"different platforms may explicitly limit the maximum indentation level."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A formfeed character may be present at the start of the line; it will be "
"ignored for the indentation calculations above.  Formfeed characters "
"occurring elsewhere in the leading whitespace have an undefined effect (for "
"instance, they may reset the space count to zero)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The indentation levels of consecutive lines are used to generate INDENT and "
"DEDENT tokens, using a stack, as follows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before the first line of the file is read, a single zero is pushed on the "
"stack; this will never be popped off again.  The numbers pushed on the stack "
"will always be strictly increasing from bottom to top.  At the beginning of "
"each logical line, the line's indentation level is compared to the top of "
"the stack. If it is equal, nothing happens. If it is larger, it is pushed on "
"the stack, and one INDENT token is generated.  If it is smaller, it *must* "
"be one of the numbers occurring on the stack; all numbers on the stack that "
"are larger are popped off, and for each number popped off a DEDENT token is "
"generated.  At the end of the file, a DEDENT token is generated for each "
"number remaining on the stack that is larger than zero."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here is an example of a correctly (though confusingly) indented piece of "
"Python code::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The following example shows various indentation errors::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"(Actually, the first three errors are detected by the parser; only the last "
"error is found by the lexical analyzer --- the indentation of ``return r`` "
"does not match a level popped off the stack.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Whitespace between tokens"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Except at the beginning of a logical line or in string literals, the "
"whitespace characters space, tab and formfeed can be used interchangeably to "
"separate tokens.  Whitespace is needed between two tokens only if their "
"concatenation could otherwise be interpreted as a different token (e.g., ab "
"is one token, but a b is two tokens)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Other tokens"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Besides NEWLINE, INDENT and DEDENT, the following categories of tokens "
"exist: *identifiers*, *keywords*, *literals*, *operators*, and *delimiters*. "
"Whitespace characters (other than line terminators, discussed earlier) are "
"not tokens, but serve to delimit tokens. Where ambiguity exists, a token "
"comprises the longest possible string that forms a legal token, when read "
"from left to right."
msgstr ""

msgid "Identifiers and keywords"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Identifiers (also referred to as *names*) are described by the following "
"lexical definitions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The syntax of identifiers in Python is based on the Unicode standard annex "
"UAX-31, with elaboration and changes as defined below; see also :pep:`3131` "
"for further details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Within the ASCII range (U+0001..U+007F), the valid characters for "
"identifiers are the same as in Python 2.x: the uppercase and lowercase "
"letters ``A`` through ``Z``, the underscore ``_`` and, except for the first "
"character, the digits ``0`` through ``9``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python 3.0 introduces additional characters from outside the ASCII range "
"(see :pep:`3131`).  For these characters, the classification uses the "
"version of the Unicode Character Database as included in the :mod:"
"`unicodedata` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "Identifiers are unlimited in length.  Case is significant."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Unicode category codes mentioned above stand for:"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Lu* - uppercase letters"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Ll* - lowercase letters"

msgid "Keywords"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following identifiers are used as reserved words, or *keywords* of the "
"language, and cannot be used as ordinary identifiers.  They must be spelled "
"exactly as written here:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Soft Keywords"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some identifiers are only reserved under specific contexts. These are known "
"as *soft keywords*.  The identifiers ``match``, ``case``, ``type`` and ``_`` "
"can syntactically act as keywords in certain contexts, but this distinction "
"is done at the parser level, not when tokenizing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As soft keywords, their use in the grammar is possible while still "
"preserving compatibility with existing code that uses these names as "
"identifier names."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``match``, ``case``, and ``_`` are used in the :keyword:`match` statement. "
"``type`` is used in the :keyword:`type` statement."
msgstr ""

msgid "``type`` is now a soft keyword."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reserved classes of identifiers"

msgid ""
"Separately, the interactive interpreter makes the result of the last "
"evaluation available in the variable ``_``. (It is stored in the :mod:"
"`builtins` module, alongside built-in functions like ``print``.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elsewhere, ``_`` is a regular identifier. It is often used to name "
"\"special\" items, but it is not special to Python itself."

msgid ""
"The name ``_`` is often used in conjunction with internationalization; refer "

"section and elsewhere. More will likely be defined in future versions of "
"Python.  *Any* use of ``__*__`` names, in any context, that does not follow "
"explicitly documented use, is subject to breakage without warning."
msgstr ""

msgid "``__*``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Class-private names.  Names in this category, when used within the context "

msgstr ""

msgid "Literals"
msgstr ""

msgid "Literals are notations for constant values of some built-in types."
msgstr ""

msgid "String and Bytes literals"
msgstr ""

msgid "String literals are described by the following lexical definitions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One syntactic restriction not indicated by these productions is that "
"whitespace is not allowed between the :token:`~python-grammar:stringprefix` "
"or :token:`~python-grammar:bytesprefix` and the rest of the literal. The "
"source character set is defined by the encoding declaration; it is UTF-8 if "
"no encoding declaration is given in the source file; see section :ref:"
"`encodings`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In plain English: Both types of literals can be enclosed in matching single "
"quotes (``'``) or double quotes (``\"``).  They can also be enclosed in "
"matching groups of three single or double quotes (these are generally "
"referred to as *triple-quoted strings*). The backslash (``\\``) character is "
"used to give special meaning to otherwise ordinary characters like ``n``, "
"which means 'newline' when escaped (``\\n``). It can also be used to escape "
"characters that otherwise have a special meaning, such as newline, backslash "
"itself, or the quote character. See :ref:`escape sequences <escape-"
"sequences>` below for examples."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bytes literals are always prefixed with ``'b'`` or ``'B'``; they produce an "
"instance of the :class:`bytes` type instead of the :class:`str` type.  They "
"may only contain ASCII characters; bytes with a numeric value of 128 or "
"greater must be expressed with escapes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Both string and bytes literals may optionally be prefixed with a letter "
"``'r'`` or ``'R'``; such strings are called :dfn:`raw strings` and treat "
"backslashes as literal characters.  As a result, in string literals, "
"``'\\U'`` and ``'\\u'`` escapes in raw strings are not treated specially. "
"Given that Python 2.x's raw unicode literals behave differently than Python "
"3.x's the ``'ur'`` syntax is not supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``'rb'`` prefix of raw bytes literals has been added as a synonym of "
"``'br'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for the unicode legacy literal (``u'value'``) was reintroduced to "
"simplify the maintenance of dual Python 2.x and 3.x codebases. See :pep:"
"`414` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A string literal with ``'f'`` or ``'F'`` in its prefix is a :dfn:`formatted "
"string literal`; see :ref:`f-strings`.  The ``'f'`` may be combined with "
"``'r'``, but not with ``'b'`` or ``'u'``, therefore raw formatted strings "
"are possible, but formatted bytes literals are not."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In triple-quoted literals, unescaped newlines and quotes are allowed (and "
"are retained), except that three unescaped quotes in a row terminate the "
"literal.  (A \"quote\" is the character used to open the literal, i.e. "
"either ``'`` or ``\"``.)"

"useful when debugging: if an escape sequence is mistyped, the resulting "
"output is more easily recognized as broken.)  It is also important to note "

"string literal consisting of two characters: a backslash and a double quote; "
"``r\"\\\"`` is not a valid string literal (even a raw string cannot end in "
"an odd number of backslashes).  Specifically, *a raw literal cannot end in a "
"single backslash* (since the backslash would escape the following quote "
"character).  Note also that a single backslash followed by a newline is "
"interpreted as those two characters as part of the literal, *not* as a line "
"continuation."
msgstr ""

msgid "String literal concatenation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multiple adjacent string or bytes literals (delimited by whitespace), "
"possibly using different quoting conventions, are allowed, and their meaning "
"is the same as their concatenation.  Thus, ``\"hello\" 'world'`` is "
"equivalent to ``\"helloworld\"``.  This feature can be used to reduce the "
"number of backslashes needed, to split long strings conveniently across long "
"lines, or even to add comments to parts of strings, for example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that this feature is defined at the syntactical level, but implemented "
"at compile time.  The '+' operator must be used to concatenate string "
"expressions at run time.  Also note that literal concatenation can use "
"different quoting styles for each component (even mixing raw strings and "
"triple quoted strings), and formatted string literals may be concatenated "
"with plain string literals."
msgstr ""

msgid "Formatted string literals"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :dfn:`formatted string literal` or :dfn:`f-string` is a string literal "
"that is prefixed with ``'f'`` or ``'F'``.  These strings may contain "
"replacement fields, which are expressions delimited by curly braces ``{}``. "
"While other string literals always have a constant value, formatted strings "
"are really expressions evaluated at run time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Escape sequences are decoded like in ordinary string literals (except when a "
"literal is also marked as a raw string).  After decoding, the grammar for "
"the contents of the string is:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The parts of the string outside curly braces are treated literally, except "
"that any doubled curly braces ``'{{'`` or ``'}}'`` are replaced with the "
"corresponding single curly brace.  A single opening curly bracket ``'{'`` "
"marks a replacement field, which starts with a Python expression. To display "
"both the expression text and its value after evaluation, (useful in "
"debugging), an equal sign ``'='`` may be added after the expression. A "
"conversion field, introduced by an exclamation point ``'!'`` may follow.  A "
"format specifier may also be appended, introduced by a colon ``':'``. A "
"replacement field ends with a closing curly bracket ``'}'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Expressions in formatted string literals are treated like regular Python "
"expressions surrounded by parentheses, with a few exceptions. An empty "
"expression is not allowed, and both :keyword:`lambda`  and assignment "
"expressions ``:=`` must be surrounded by explicit parentheses. Each "
"expression is evaluated in the context where the formatted string literal "
"appears, in order from left to right.  Replacement expressions can contain "
"newlines in both single-quoted and triple-quoted f-strings and they can "
"contain comments.  Everything that comes after a ``#`` inside a replacement "
"field is a comment (even closing braces and quotes). In that case, "
"replacement fields must be closed in a different line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Prior to Python 3.7, an :keyword:`await` expression and comprehensions "
"containing an :keyword:`async for` clause were illegal in the expressions in "
"formatted string literals due to a problem with the implementation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Prior to Python 3.12, comments were not allowed inside f-string replacement "
"fields."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the equal sign ``'='`` is provided, the output will have the expression "
"text, the ``'='`` and the evaluated value. Spaces after the opening brace "
"``'{'``, within the expression and after the ``'='`` are all retained in the "
"output. By default, the ``'='`` causes the :func:`repr` of the expression to "
"be provided, unless there is a format specified. When a format is specified "
"it defaults to the :func:`str` of the expression unless a conversion ``'!"
"r'`` is declared."
msgstr ""

msgid "The equal sign ``'='``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a conversion is specified, the result of evaluating the expression is "
"converted before formatting.  Conversion ``'!s'`` calls :func:`str` on the "
"result, ``'!r'`` calls :func:`repr`, and ``'!a'`` calls :func:`ascii`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The result is then formatted using the :func:`format` protocol.  The format "
"specifier is passed to the :meth:`__format__` method of the expression or "
"conversion result.  An empty string is passed when the format specifier is "
"omitted.  The formatted result is then included in the final value of the "
"whole string."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Top-level format specifiers may include nested replacement fields. These "
"nested fields may include their own conversion fields and :ref:`format "

"There are three types of numeric literals: integers, floating point numbers, "
"and imaginary numbers.  There are no complex literals (complex numbers can "
"be formed by adding a real number and an imaginary number)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that numeric literals do not include a sign; a phrase like ``-1`` is "
"actually an expression composed of the unary operator '``-``' and the "
"literal ``1``."

"There is no limit for the length of integer literals apart from what can be "
"stored in available memory."

msgid ""
"Underscores are ignored for determining the numeric value of the literal.  "
"They can be used to group digits for enhanced readability.  One underscore "
"can occur between digits, and after base specifiers like ``0x``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that leading zeros in a non-zero decimal number are not allowed. This "
"is for disambiguation with C-style octal literals, which Python used before "
"version 3.0."

"Floating point literals are described by the following lexical definitions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the integer and exponent parts are always interpreted using radix "
"10. For example, ``077e010`` is legal, and denotes the same number as "
"``77e10``. The allowed range of floating point literals is implementation-"
"dependent.  As in integer literals, underscores are supported for digit "
"grouping."

"An imaginary literal yields a complex number with a real part of 0.0.  "
"Complex numbers are represented as a pair of floating point numbers and have "
"the same restrictions on their range.  To create a complex number with a "
"nonzero real part, add a floating point number to it, e.g., ``(3+4j)``.  "
