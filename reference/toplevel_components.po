"The Python interpreter can get its input from a number of sources: from a "
"script passed to it as standard input or as program argument, typed in "
"interactively, from a module source file, etc.  This chapter gives the "
"syntax used in these cases."

msgid "Complete Python programs"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While a language specification need not prescribe how the language "
"interpreter is invoked, it is useful to have a notion of a complete Python "
"program.  A complete Python program is executed in a minimally initialized "
"environment: all built-in and standard modules are available, but none have "
"been initialized, except for :mod:`sys` (various system services), :mod:"
"`builtins` (built-in functions, exceptions and ``None``) and :mod:"
"`__main__`.  The latter is used to provide the local and global namespace "
"for execution of the complete program."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The syntax for a complete Python program is that for file input, described "
"in the next section."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The interpreter may also be invoked in interactive mode; in this case, it "
"does not read and execute a complete program but reads and executes one "
"statement (possibly compound) at a time.  The initial environment is "
"identical to that of a complete program; each statement is executed in the "
"namespace of :mod:`__main__`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A complete program can be passed to the interpreter in three forms: with "
"the :option:`-c` *string* command line option, as a file passed as the first "
"command line argument, or as standard input.  If the file or standard input "
"is a tty device, the interpreter enters interactive mode; otherwise, it "
"executes the file as a complete program."
msgstr ""

msgid "File input"
msgstr ""

msgid "All input read from non-interactive files has the same form:"
msgstr ""

msgid "This syntax is used in the following situations:"
msgstr ""

msgid "when parsing a complete Python program (from a file or from a string);"
msgstr ""

msgid "when parsing a module;"
msgstr ""

msgid "when parsing a string passed to the :func:`exec` function;"
msgstr ""

msgid "Interactive input"
msgstr ""

msgid "Input in interactive mode is parsed using the following grammar:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that a (top-level) compound statement must be followed by a blank line "
"in interactive mode; this is needed to help the parser detect the end of the "
"input."
msgstr ""

msgid "Expression input"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`eval` is used for expression input.  It ignores leading whitespace. "
"The string argument to :func:`eval` must have the following form:"
