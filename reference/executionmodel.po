msgid ""
"A Python program is constructed from code blocks. A :dfn:`block` is a piece "
"of Python program text that is executed as a unit. The following are blocks: "
"a module, a function body, and a class definition. Each command typed "
"interactively is a block.  A script file (a file given as standard input to "
"the interpreter or specified as a command line argument to the interpreter) "
"is a code block.  A script command (a command specified on the interpreter "
"command line with the :option:`-c` option) is a code block. A module run as "
"a top level script (as module ``__main__``) from the command line using a :"
"option:`-m` argument is also a code block. The string argument passed to the "
"built-in functions :func:`eval` and :func:`exec` is a code block."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A code block is executed in an :dfn:`execution frame`.  A frame contains "
"some administrative information (used for debugging) and determines where "
"and how execution continues after the code block's execution has completed."

"The :keyword:`!import` statement of the form ``from ... import *`` binds all "
"names defined in the imported module, except those beginning with an "
"underscore. This form may only be used at the module level."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A target occurring in a :keyword:`del` statement is also considered bound "
"for this purpose (though the actual semantics are to unbind the name)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each assignment or import statement occurs within a block defined by a class "
"or function definition or at the module level (the top-level code block)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a name is bound in a block, it is a local variable of that block, unless "
"declared as :keyword:`nonlocal` or :keyword:`global`.  If a name is bound at "
"the module level, it is a global variable.  (The variables of the module "
"code block are local and global.)  If a variable is used in a code block but "
"not defined there, it is a :dfn:`free variable`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each occurrence of a name in the program text refers to the :dfn:`binding` "
"of that name established by the following name resolution rules."
msgstr ""

msgid "Resolution of names"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :dfn:`scope` defines the visibility of a name within a block.  If a local "
"variable is defined in a block, its scope includes that block.  If the "
"definition occurs in a function block, the scope extends to any blocks "
"contained within the defining one, unless a contained block introduces a "
"different binding for the name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a name is used in a code block, it is resolved using the nearest "
"enclosing scope.  The set of all such scopes visible to a code block is "
"called the block's :dfn:`environment`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a name is not found at all, a :exc:`NameError` exception is raised. If "
"the current scope is a function scope, and the name refers to a local "
"variable that has not yet been bound to a value at the point where the name "
"is used, an :exc:`UnboundLocalError` exception is raised. :exc:"
"`UnboundLocalError` is a subclass of :exc:`NameError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a name binding operation occurs anywhere within a code block, all uses of "
"the name within the block are treated as references to the current block.  "
"This can lead to errors when a name is used within a block before it is "
"bound.  This rule is subtle.  Python lacks declarations and allows name "
"binding operations to occur anywhere within a code block.  The local "
"variables of a code block can be determined by scanning the entire text of "
"the block for name binding operations. See :ref:`the FAQ entry on "
"UnboundLocalError <faq-unboundlocalerror>` for examples."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the :keyword:`global` statement occurs within a block, all uses of the "
"names specified in the statement refer to the bindings of those names in the "
"top-level namespace.  Names are resolved in the top-level namespace by "
"searching the global namespace, i.e. the namespace of the module containing "
"the code block, and the builtins namespace, the namespace of the module :mod:"
"`builtins`.  The global namespace is searched first.  If the names are not "
"found there, the builtins namespace is searched.  The :keyword:`!global` "
"statement must precede all uses of the listed names."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :keyword:`global` statement has the same scope as a name binding "
"operation in the same block.  If the nearest enclosing scope for a free "
"variable contains a global statement, the free variable is treated as a "
"global."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :keyword:`nonlocal` statement causes corresponding names to refer to "
"previously bound variables in the nearest enclosing function scope. :exc:"
"`SyntaxError` is raised at compile time if the given name does not exist in "
"any enclosing function scope. :ref:`Type parameters <type-params>` cannot be "
"rebound with the :keyword:`!nonlocal` statement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The namespace for a module is automatically created the first time a module "
"is imported.  The main module for a script is always called :mod:`__main__`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Class definition blocks and arguments to :func:`exec` and :func:`eval` are "
"special in the context of name resolution. A class definition is an "
"executable statement that may use and define names. These references follow "
"the normal rules for name resolution with an exception that unbound local "
"variables are looked up in the global namespace. The namespace of the class "
"definition becomes the attribute dictionary of the class. The scope of names "
"defined in a class block is limited to the class block; it does not extend "
"to the code blocks of methods. This includes comprehensions and generator "
"expressions, but it does not include :ref:`annotation scopes <annotation-"
"scopes>`, which have access to their enclosing class scopes. This means that "
"the following will fail::"
msgstr ""

msgid "However, the following will succeed::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Annotation scopes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Type parameter lists <type-params>` and :keyword:`type` statements "
"introduce *annotation scopes*, which behave mostly like function scopes, but "
"with some exceptions discussed below. :term:`Annotations <annotation>` "
"currently do not use annotation scopes, but they are expected to use "
"annotation scopes in Python 3.13 when :pep:`649` is implemented."
msgstr ""

msgid "Annotation scopes are used in the following contexts:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Type parameter lists for :ref:`generic type aliases <generic-type-aliases>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Type parameter lists for :ref:`generic functions <generic-functions>`. A "
"generic function's annotations are executed within the annotation scope, but "
"its defaults and decorators are not."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Type parameter lists for :ref:`generic classes <generic-classes>`. A generic "
"class's base classes and keyword arguments are executed within the "
"annotation scope, but its decorators are not."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The bounds and constraints for type variables (:ref:`lazily evaluated <lazy-"
"evaluation>`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The value of type aliases (:ref:`lazily evaluated <lazy-evaluation>`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Annotation scopes differ from function scopes in the following ways:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Annotation scopes have access to their enclosing class namespace. If an "
"annotation scope is immediately within a class scope, or within another "
"annotation scope that is immediately within a class scope, the code in the "
"annotation scope can use names defined in the class scope as if it were "
"executed directly within the class body. This contrasts with regular "
"functions defined within classes, which cannot access names defined in the "
"class scope."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Expressions in annotation scopes cannot contain :keyword:`yield`, ``yield "
"from``, :keyword:`await`, or :token:`:= <python-grammar:"
"assignment_expression>` expressions. (These expressions are allowed in other "
"scopes contained within the annotation scope.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Names defined in annotation scopes cannot be rebound with :keyword:"
"`nonlocal` statements in inner scopes. This includes only type parameters, "
"as no other syntactic elements that can appear within annotation scopes can "
"introduce new names."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While annotation scopes have an internal name, that name is not reflected in "
"the :term:`__qualname__ <qualified name>` of objects defined within the "
"scope. Instead, the :attr:`!__qualname__` of such objects is as if the "
"object were defined in the enclosing scope."
msgstr ""

msgid "Annotation scopes were introduced in Python 3.12 as part of :pep:`695`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Lazy evaluation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The values of type aliases created through the :keyword:`type` statement are "
"*lazily evaluated*. The same applies to the bounds and constraints of type "
"variables created through the :ref:`type parameter syntax <type-params>`. "
"This means that they are not evaluated when the type alias or type variable "
"is created. Instead, they are only evaluated when doing so is necessary to "
"resolve an attribute access."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here the exception is raised only when the ``__value__`` attribute of the "
"type alias or the ``__bound__`` attribute of the type variable is accessed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This behavior is primarily useful for references to types that have not yet "
"been defined when the type alias or type variable is created. For example, "
"lazy evaluation enables creation of mutually recursive type aliases::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Lazily evaluated values are evaluated in :ref:`annotation scope <annotation-"
"scopes>`, which means that names that appear inside the lazily evaluated "
"value are looked up as if they were used in the immediately enclosing scope."
msgstr ""

msgid "Builtins and restricted execution"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Users should not touch ``__builtins__``; it is strictly an implementation "
"detail.  Users wanting to override values in the builtins namespace should :"
"keyword:`import` the :mod:`builtins` module and modify its attributes "
"appropriately."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The builtins namespace associated with the execution of a code block is "
"actually found by looking up the name ``__builtins__`` in its global "
"namespace; this should be a dictionary or a module (in the latter case the "
"module's dictionary is used).  By default, when in the :mod:`__main__` "
"module, ``__builtins__`` is the built-in module :mod:`builtins`; when in any "
"other module, ``__builtins__`` is an alias for the dictionary of the :mod:"
"`builtins` module itself."
msgstr ""

msgid "Interaction with dynamic features"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Name resolution of free variables occurs at runtime, not at compile time. "
"This means that the following code will print 42::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`eval` and :func:`exec` functions do not have access to the full "
"environment for resolving names.  Names may be resolved in the local and "
"global namespaces of the caller.  Free variables are not resolved in the "
"nearest enclosing namespace, but in the global namespace.  [#]_ The :func:"
"`exec` and :func:`eval` functions have optional arguments to override the "
"global and local namespace.  If only one namespace is specified, it is used "
"for both."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exceptions"
msgstr "Wyjątki"

msgid ""
"Exceptions are a means of breaking out of the normal flow of control of a "
"code block in order to handle errors or other exceptional conditions.  An "
"exception is *raised* at the point where the error is detected; it may be "
"*handled* by the surrounding code block or by any code block that directly "
"or indirectly invoked the code block where the error occurred."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Python interpreter raises an exception when it detects a run-time error "
"(such as division by zero).  A Python program can also explicitly raise an "
"exception with the :keyword:`raise` statement. Exception handlers are "
"specified with the :keyword:`try` ... :keyword:`except` statement.  The :"
"keyword:`finally` clause of such a statement can be used to specify cleanup "
"code which does not handle the exception, but is executed whether an "
"exception occurred or not in the preceding code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python uses the \"termination\" model of error handling: an exception "
"handler can find out what happened and continue execution at an outer level, "
"but it cannot repair the cause of the error and retry the failing operation "
"(except by re-entering the offending piece of code from the top)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When an exception is not handled at all, the interpreter terminates "
"execution of the program, or returns to its interactive main loop.  In "
"either case, it prints a stack traceback, except when the exception is :exc:"
"`SystemExit`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exceptions are identified by class instances.  The :keyword:`except` clause "
"is selected depending on the class of the instance: it must reference the "
"class of the instance or a :term:`non-virtual base class <abstract base "
"class>` thereof. The instance can be received by the handler and can carry "
"additional information about the exceptional condition."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exception messages are not part of the Python API.  Their contents may "
"change from one version of Python to the next without warning and should not "
"be relied on by code which will run under multiple versions of the "
"interpreter."

"`try` and :keyword:`raise` statement in section :ref:`raise`."
