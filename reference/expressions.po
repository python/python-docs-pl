msgid "Expressions"

msgid ""
"This chapter explains the meaning of the elements of expressions in Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Syntax Notes:** In this and the following chapters, extended BNF notation "
"will be used to describe syntax, not lexical analysis.  When (one "
"alternative of) a syntax rule has the form"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"and no semantics are given, the semantics of this form of ``name`` are the "
"same as for ``othername``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Arithmetic conversions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a description of an arithmetic operator below uses the phrase \"the "
"numeric arguments are converted to a common type\", this means that the "
"operator implementation for built-in types works as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If either argument is a complex number, the other is converted to complex;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"otherwise, if either argument is a floating point number, the other is "
"converted to floating point;"
msgstr ""

msgid "otherwise, both must be integers and no conversion is necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some additional rules apply for certain operators (e.g., a string as a left "
"argument to the '%' operator).  Extensions must define their own conversion "
"behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid "Atoms"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Atoms are the most basic elements of expressions.  The simplest atoms are "
"identifiers or literals.  Forms enclosed in parentheses, brackets or braces "
"are also categorized syntactically as atoms.  The syntax for atoms is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Identifiers (Names)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An identifier occurring as an atom is a name.  See section :ref:"
"`identifiers` for lexical definition and section :ref:`naming` for "
"documentation of naming and binding."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the name is bound to an object, evaluation of the atom yields that "
"object. When a name is not bound, an attempt to evaluate it raises a :exc:"
"`NameError` exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Private name mangling:** When an identifier that textually occurs in a "
"class definition begins with two or more underscore characters and does not "
"end in two or more underscores, it is considered a :dfn:`private name` of "
"that class. Private names are transformed to a longer form before code is "
"generated for them.  The transformation inserts the class name, with leading "
"underscores removed and a single underscore inserted, in front of the name.  "
"For example, the identifier ``__spam`` occurring in a class named ``Ham`` "
"will be transformed to ``_Ham__spam``.  This transformation is independent "
"of the syntactical context in which the identifier is used.  If the "
"transformed name is extremely long (longer than 255 characters), "
"implementation defined truncation may happen. If the class name consists "
"only of underscores, no transformation is done."
msgstr ""

msgid "Literals"
msgstr ""

msgid "Python supports string and bytes literals and various numeric literals:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Evaluation of a literal yields an object of the given type (string, bytes, "
"integer, floating point number, complex number) with the given value.  The "
"value may be approximated in the case of floating point and imaginary "
"(complex) literals.  See section :ref:`literals` for details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All literals correspond to immutable data types, and hence the object's "
"identity is less important than its value.  Multiple evaluations of literals "
"with the same value (either the same occurrence in the program text or a "
"different occurrence) may obtain the same object or a different object with "
"the same value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parenthesized forms"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A parenthesized form is an optional expression list enclosed in parentheses:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A parenthesized expression list yields whatever that expression list yields: "
"if the list contains at least one comma, it yields a tuple; otherwise, it "
"yields the single expression that makes up the expression list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An empty pair of parentheses yields an empty tuple object.  Since tuples are "
"immutable, the same rules as for literals apply (i.e., two occurrences of "
"the empty tuple may or may not yield the same object)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that tuples are not formed by the parentheses, but rather by use of the "
"comma.  The exception is the empty tuple, for which parentheses *are* "
"required --- allowing unparenthesized \"nothing\" in expressions would cause "
"ambiguities and allow common typos to pass uncaught."
msgstr ""

msgid "Displays for lists, sets and dictionaries"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For constructing a list, a set or a dictionary Python provides special "
"syntax called \"displays\", each of them in two flavors:"
msgstr ""

msgid "either the container contents are listed explicitly, or"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"they are computed via a set of looping and filtering instructions, called a :"
"dfn:`comprehension`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Common syntax elements for comprehensions are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The comprehension consists of a single expression followed by at least one :"
"keyword:`!for` clause and zero or more :keyword:`!for` or :keyword:`!if` "
"clauses. In this case, the elements of the new container are those that "
"would be produced by considering each of the :keyword:`!for` or :keyword:`!"
"if` clauses a block, nesting from left to right, and evaluating the "
"expression to produce an element each time the innermost block is reached."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, aside from the iterable expression in the leftmost :keyword:`!for` "
"clause, the comprehension is executed in a separate implicitly nested scope. "
"This ensures that names assigned to in the target list don't \"leak\" into "
"the enclosing scope."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The iterable expression in the leftmost :keyword:`!for` clause is evaluated "
"directly in the enclosing scope and then passed as an argument to the "
"implicitly nested scope. Subsequent :keyword:`!for` clauses and any filter "
"condition in the leftmost :keyword:`!for` clause cannot be evaluated in the "
"enclosing scope as they may depend on the values obtained from the leftmost "
"iterable. For example: ``[x*y for x in range(10) for y in range(x, x+10)]``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To ensure the comprehension always results in a container of the appropriate "
"type, ``yield`` and ``yield from`` expressions are prohibited in the "
"implicitly nested scope."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since Python 3.6, in an :keyword:`async def` function, an :keyword:`!async "
"for` clause may be used to iterate over a :term:`asynchronous iterator`. A "
"comprehension in an :keyword:`!async def` function may consist of either a :"
"keyword:`!for` or :keyword:`!async for` clause following the leading "
"expression, may contain additional :keyword:`!for` or :keyword:`!async for` "
"clauses, and may also use :keyword:`await` expressions. If a comprehension "
"contains either :keyword:`!async for` clauses or :keyword:`!await` "
"expressions or other asynchronous comprehensions it is called an :dfn:"
"`asynchronous comprehension`.  An asynchronous comprehension may suspend the "
"execution of the coroutine function in which it appears. See also :pep:`530`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Asynchronous comprehensions were introduced."
msgstr ""

msgid "``yield`` and ``yield from`` prohibited in the implicitly nested scope."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Asynchronous comprehensions are now allowed inside comprehensions in "
"asynchronous functions. Outer comprehensions implicitly become asynchronous."
msgstr ""

msgid "List displays"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A list display is a possibly empty series of expressions enclosed in square "
"brackets:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A list display yields a new list object, the contents being specified by "
"either a list of expressions or a comprehension.  When a comma-separated "
"list of expressions is supplied, its elements are evaluated from left to "
"right and placed into the list object in that order.  When a comprehension "
"is supplied, the list is constructed from the elements resulting from the "
"comprehension."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set displays"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A set display is denoted by curly braces and distinguishable from dictionary "
"displays by the lack of colons separating keys and values:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A set display yields a new mutable set object, the contents being specified "
"by either a sequence of expressions or a comprehension.  When a comma-"
"separated list of expressions is supplied, its elements are evaluated from "
"left to right and added to the set object.  When a comprehension is "
"supplied, the set is constructed from the elements resulting from the "
"comprehension."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An empty set cannot be constructed with ``{}``; this literal constructs an "
"empty dictionary."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dictionary displays"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A dictionary display is a possibly empty series of key/datum pairs enclosed "
"in curly braces:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A dictionary display yields a new dictionary object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a comma-separated sequence of key/datum pairs is given, they are "
"evaluated from left to right to define the entries of the dictionary: each "
"key object is used as a key into the dictionary to store the corresponding "
"datum.  This means that you can specify the same key multiple times in the "
"key/datum list, and the final dictionary's value for that key will be the "
"last one given."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A double asterisk ``**`` denotes :dfn:`dictionary unpacking`. Its operand "
"must be a :term:`mapping`.  Each mapping item is added to the new "
"dictionary.  Later values replace values already set by earlier key/datum "
"pairs and earlier dictionary unpackings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unpacking into dictionary displays, originally proposed by :pep:`448`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A dict comprehension, in contrast to list and set comprehensions, needs two "
"expressions separated with a colon followed by the usual \"for\" and \"if\" "
"clauses. When the comprehension is run, the resulting key and value elements "
"are inserted in the new dictionary in the order they are produced."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Restrictions on the types of the key values are listed earlier in section :"
"ref:`types`.  (To summarize, the key type should be :term:`hashable`, which "
"excludes all mutable objects.)  Clashes between duplicate keys are not "
"detected; the last datum (textually rightmost in the display) stored for a "
"given key value prevails."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Prior to Python 3.8, in dict comprehensions, the evaluation order of key and "
"value was not well-defined.  In CPython, the value was evaluated before the "
"key.  Starting with 3.8, the key is evaluated before the value, as proposed "
"by :pep:`572`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Generator expressions"
msgstr ""

msgid "A generator expression is a compact generator notation in parentheses:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A generator expression yields a new generator object.  Its syntax is the "
"same as for comprehensions, except that it is enclosed in parentheses "
"instead of brackets or curly braces."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Variables used in the generator expression are evaluated lazily when the :"
"meth:`~generator.__next__` method is called for the generator object (in the "
"same fashion as normal generators).  However, the iterable expression in the "
"leftmost :keyword:`!for` clause is immediately evaluated, so that an error "
"produced by it will be emitted at the point where the generator expression "
"is defined, rather than at the point where the first value is retrieved. "
"Subsequent :keyword:`!for` clauses and any filter condition in the leftmost :"
"keyword:`!for` clause cannot be evaluated in the enclosing scope as they may "
"depend on the values obtained from the leftmost iterable. For example: "
"``(x*y for x in range(10) for y in range(x, x+10))``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The parentheses can be omitted on calls with only one argument.  See "
"section :ref:`calls` for details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To avoid interfering with the expected operation of the generator expression "
"itself, ``yield`` and ``yield from`` expressions are prohibited in the "
"implicitly defined generator."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a generator expression contains either :keyword:`!async for` clauses or :"
"keyword:`await` expressions it is called an :dfn:`asynchronous generator "
"expression`.  An asynchronous generator expression returns a new "
"asynchronous generator object, which is an asynchronous iterator (see :ref:"
"`async-iterators`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Asynchronous generator expressions were introduced."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Prior to Python 3.7, asynchronous generator expressions could only appear "
"in :keyword:`async def` coroutines.  Starting with 3.7, any function can use "
"asynchronous generator expressions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Yield expressions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The yield expression is used when defining a :term:`generator` function or "
"an :term:`asynchronous generator` function and thus can only be used in the "
"body of a function definition.  Using a yield expression in a function's "
"body causes that function to be a generator function, and using it in an :"
"keyword:`async def` function's body causes that coroutine function to be an "
"asynchronous generator function. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to their side effects on the containing scope, ``yield`` expressions are "
"not permitted as part of the implicitly defined scopes used to implement "
"comprehensions and generator expressions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Yield expressions prohibited in the implicitly nested scopes used to "
"implement comprehensions and generator expressions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Generator functions are described below, while asynchronous generator "
"functions are described separately in section :ref:`asynchronous-generator-"
"functions`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a generator function is called, it returns an iterator known as a "
"generator.  That generator then controls the execution of the generator "
"function.  The execution starts when one of the generator's methods is "
"called. At that time, the execution proceeds to the first yield expression, "
"where it is suspended again, returning the value of :token:`~python-grammar:"
"expression_list` to the generator's caller, or ``None`` if :token:`~python-"
"grammar:expression_list` is omitted. By suspended, we mean that all local "
"state is retained, including the current bindings of local variables, the "
"instruction pointer, the internal evaluation stack, and the state of any "
"exception handling. When the execution is resumed by calling one of the "
"generator's methods, the function can proceed exactly as if the yield "
"expression were just another external call.  The value of the yield "
"expression after resuming depends on the method which resumed the "
"execution.  If :meth:`~generator.__next__` is used (typically via either a :"
"keyword:`for` or the :func:`next` builtin) then the result is :const:"
"`None`.  Otherwise, if :meth:`~generator.send` is used, then the result will "
"be the value passed in to that method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All of this makes generator functions quite similar to coroutines; they "
"yield multiple times, they have more than one entry point and their "
"execution can be suspended.  The only difference is that a generator "
"function cannot control where the execution should continue after it yields; "
"the control is always transferred to the generator's caller."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Yield expressions are allowed anywhere in a :keyword:`try` construct.  If "
"the generator is not resumed before it is finalized (by reaching a zero "
"reference count or by being garbage collected), the generator-iterator's :"
"meth:`~generator.close` method will be called, allowing any pending :keyword:"
"`finally` clauses to execute."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When ``yield from <expr>`` is used, the supplied expression must be an "
"iterable. The values produced by iterating that iterable are passed directly "
"to the caller of the current generator's methods. Any values passed in with :"
"meth:`~generator.send` and any exceptions passed in with :meth:`~generator."
"throw` are passed to the underlying iterator if it has the appropriate "
"methods.  If this is not the case, then :meth:`~generator.send` will raise :"
"exc:`AttributeError` or :exc:`TypeError`, while :meth:`~generator.throw` "
"will just raise the passed in exception immediately."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the underlying iterator is complete, the :attr:`~StopIteration.value` "
"attribute of the raised :exc:`StopIteration` instance becomes the value of "
"the yield expression. It can be either set explicitly when raising :exc:"
"`StopIteration`, or automatically when the subiterator is a generator (by "
"returning a value from the subgenerator)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added ``yield from <expr>`` to delegate control flow to a subiterator."

"expression on the right hand side of an assignment statement."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This subsection describes the methods of a generator iterator.  They can be "
"used to control the execution of a generator function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that calling any of the generator methods below when the generator is "
"already executing raises a :exc:`ValueError` exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Starts the execution of a generator function or resumes it at the last "
"executed yield expression.  When a generator function is resumed with a :"
"meth:`~generator.__next__` method, the current yield expression always "
"evaluates to :const:`None`.  The execution then continues to the next yield "
"expression, where the generator is suspended again, and the value of the :"
"token:`~python-grammar:expression_list` is returned to :meth:`__next__`'s "
"caller.  If the generator exits without yielding another value, a :exc:"
"`StopIteration` exception is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is normally called implicitly, e.g. by a :keyword:`for` loop, or "
"by the built-in :func:`next` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Resumes the execution and \"sends\" a value into the generator function.  "
"The *value* argument becomes the result of the current yield expression.  "
"The :meth:`send` method returns the next value yielded by the generator, or "
"raises :exc:`StopIteration` if the generator exits without yielding another "
"value.  When :meth:`send` is called to start the generator, it must be "
"called with :const:`None` as the argument, because there is no yield "
"expression that could receive the value."

"If the generator function does not catch the passed-in exception, or raises "
"a different exception, then that exception propagates to the caller."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In typical use, this is called with a single exception instance similar to "
"the way the :keyword:`raise` keyword is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For backwards compatibility, however, the second signature is supported, "
"following a convention from older versions of Python. The *type* argument "
"should be an exception class, and *value* should be an exception instance. "
"If the *value* is not provided, the *type* constructor is called to get an "
"instance. If *traceback* is provided, it is set on the exception, otherwise "
"any existing :attr:`~BaseException.__traceback__` attribute stored in "
"*value* may be cleared."

msgid ""
"The presence of a yield expression in a function or method defined using :"

"generator` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When an asynchronous generator function is called, it returns an "
"asynchronous iterator known as an asynchronous generator object. That object "
"then controls the execution of the generator function. An asynchronous "
"generator object is typically used in an :keyword:`async for` statement in a "
"coroutine function analogously to how a generator object would be used in a :"
"keyword:`for` statement."

msgid ""
"Calling one of the asynchronous generator's methods returns an :term:"

"At that time, the execution proceeds to the first yield expression, where it "

"means that all local state is retained, including the current bindings of "
"local variables, the instruction pointer, the internal evaluation stack, and "
"the state of any exception handling. When the execution is resumed by "
"awaiting on the next object returned by the asynchronous generator's "
