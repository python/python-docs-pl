msgid ""
"This reference manual describes the Python programming language. It is not "
"intended as a tutorial."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While I am trying to be as precise as possible, I chose to use English "
"rather than formal specifications for everything except syntax and lexical "
"analysis. This should make the document more understandable to the average "
"reader, but will leave room for ambiguities. Consequently, if you were "
"coming from Mars and tried to re-implement Python from this document alone, "
"you might have to guess things and in fact you would probably end up "
"implementing quite a different language. On the other hand, if you are using "
"Python and wonder what the precise rules about a particular area of the "
"language are, you should definitely be able to find them here. If you would "
"like to see a more formal definition of the language, maybe you could "
"volunteer your time --- or invent a cloning machine :-)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is dangerous to add too many implementation details to a language "
"reference document --- the implementation may change, and other "
"implementations of the same language may work differently.  On the other "
"hand, CPython is the one Python implementation in widespread use (although "
"alternate implementations continue to gain support), and its particular "
"quirks are sometimes worth being mentioned, especially where the "
"implementation imposes additional limitations. Therefore, you'll find short "
"\"implementation notes\" sprinkled throughout the text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every Python implementation comes with a number of built-in and standard "
"modules.  These are documented in :ref:`library-index`.  A few built-in "
"modules are mentioned when they interact in a significant way with the "
"language definition."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alternate Implementations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Though there is one Python implementation which is by far the most popular, "
"there are some alternate implementations which are of particular interest to "
"different audiences."
msgstr ""

msgid "Known implementations include:"
msgstr ""

msgid "CPython"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the original and most-maintained implementation of Python, written "
"in C. New language features generally appear here first."
msgstr ""

msgid "Jython"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python implemented in Java.  This implementation can be used as a scripting "
"language for Java applications, or can be used to create applications using "
"the Java class libraries.  It is also often used to create tests for Java "
"libraries. More information can be found at `the Jython website <https://www."
"jython.org/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Python for .NET"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This implementation actually uses the CPython implementation, but is a "
"managed .NET application and makes .NET libraries available.  It was created "
"by Brian Lloyd.  For more information, see the `Python for .NET home page "
"<https://pythonnet.github.io/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "IronPython"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An alternate Python for .NET.  Unlike Python.NET, this is a complete Python "
"implementation that generates IL, and compiles Python code directly to .NET "
"assemblies.  It was created by Jim Hugunin, the original creator of Jython.  "
"For more information, see `the IronPython website <https://ironpython.net/"
">`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "PyPy"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An implementation of Python written completely in Python. It supports "
"several advanced features not found in other implementations like stackless "
"support and a Just in Time compiler. One of the goals of the project is to "
"encourage experimentation with the language itself by making it easier to "
"modify the interpreter (since it is written in Python).  Additional "
"information is available on `the PyPy project's home page <https://www.pypy."
"org/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each of these implementations varies in some way from the language as "
"documented in this manual, or introduces specific information beyond what's "
"covered in the standard Python documentation.  Please refer to the "
"implementation-specific documentation to determine what else you need to "
"know about the specific implementation you're using."
msgstr ""

msgid "Notation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The descriptions of lexical analysis and syntax use a modified BNF grammar "
"notation.  This uses the following style of definition:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first line says that a ``name`` is an ``lc_letter`` followed by a "
"sequence of zero or more ``lc_letter``\\ s and underscores.  An "
"``lc_letter`` in turn is any of the single characters ``'a'`` through "
"``'z'``.  (This rule is actually adhered to for the names defined in lexical "
"and grammar rules in this document.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each rule begins with a name (which is the name defined by the rule) and ``::"
"=``.  A vertical bar (``|``) is used to separate alternatives; it is the "
"least binding operator in this notation.  A star (``*``) means zero or more "
"repetitions of the preceding item; likewise, a plus (``+``) means one or "
"more repetitions, and a phrase enclosed in square brackets (``[ ]``) means "
"zero or one occurrences (in other words, the enclosed phrase is optional).  "
"The ``*`` and ``+`` operators bind as tightly as possible; parentheses are "
"used for grouping.  Literal strings are enclosed in quotes.  White space is "
"only meaningful to separate tokens. Rules are normally contained on a single "
"line; rules with many alternatives may be formatted alternatively with each "
"line after the first beginning with a vertical bar."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In lexical definitions (as the example above), two more conventions are "
"used: Two literal characters separated by three dots mean a choice of any "
"single character in the given (inclusive) range of ASCII characters.  A "
"phrase between angular brackets (``<...>``) gives an informal description of "
"the symbol defined; e.g., this could be used to describe the notion of "
"'control character' if needed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Even though the notation used is almost the same, there is a big difference "
"between the meaning of lexical and syntactic definitions: a lexical "
"definition operates on the individual characters of the input source, while "
"a syntax definition operates on the stream of tokens generated by the "
"lexical analysis. All uses of BNF in the next chapter (\"Lexical Analysis\") "
"are lexical definitions; uses in subsequent chapters are syntactic "
"definitions."
