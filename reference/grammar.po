"This is the full Python grammar, derived directly from the grammar used to "
"generate the CPython parser (see :source:`Grammar/python.gram`). The version "

"The notation is a mixture of `EBNF <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form>`_ and `PEG <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Parsing_expression_grammar>`_. In particular, ``&`` followed by a symbol, "
"token or parenthesized group indicates a positive lookahead (i.e., is "
"required to match but not consumed), while ``!`` indicates a negative "
"lookahead (i.e., is required *not* to match).  We use the ``|`` separator to "
"mean PEG's \"ordered choice\" (written as ``/`` in traditional PEG "
"grammars). See :pep:`617` for more details on the grammar's syntax."
