msgstr "Wprowadzenie"

msgid ""
"In Python 2.0, the ``distutils`` API was first added to the standard "
"library. This provided Linux distro maintainers with a standard way of "
"converting Python projects into Linux distro packages, and system "
"administrators with a standard way of installing them directly onto target "
"systems."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the many years since Python 2.0 was released, tightly coupling the build "
"system and package installer to the language runtime release cycle has "
"turned out to be problematic, and it is now recommended that projects use "
"the ``pip`` package installer and the ``setuptools`` build system, rather "
"than using ``distutils`` directly."

"the ``setuptools`` documentation covers everything needed."

msgid "Distutils based source distributions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you download a module source distribution, you can tell pretty quickly if "
"it was packaged and distributed in the standard way, i.e. using the "
"Distutils. First, the distribution's name and version number will be "
"featured prominently in the name of the downloaded archive, e.g. :file:"
"`foo-1.0.tar.gz` or :file:`widget-0.9.7.zip`.  Next, the archive will unpack "
"into a similarly named directory: :file:`foo-1.0` or :file:`widget-0.9.7`.  "
"Additionally, the distribution will contain a setup script :file:`setup.py`, "
"and a file named :file:`README.txt` or possibly just :file:`README`, which "
"should explain that building and installing the module distribution is a "
"simple matter of running one command from a terminal::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For Windows, this command should be run from a command prompt window (:"
"menuselection:`Start --> Accessories`)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If all these things are true, then you already know how to build and install "
"the modules you've just downloaded:  Run the command above. Unless you need "
"to install things in a non-standard way or customize the build process, you "
"don't really need this manual.  Or rather, the above command is everything "
"you need to get out of this manual."
msgstr ""

msgid "Standard Build and Install"

msgid ""
"As described in section :ref:`inst-new-standard`, building and installing a "
"module distribution using the Distutils is usually one simple command to run "
"from a terminal::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Platform variations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should always run the setup command from the distribution root "
"directory, i.e. the top-level subdirectory that the module source "
"distribution unpacks into.  For example, if you've just downloaded a module "
"source distribution :file:`foo-1.0.tar.gz` onto a Unix system, the normal "
"thing to do is::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, you'd probably download :file:`foo-1.0.zip`.  If you downloaded "
"the archive file to :file:`C:\\\\Temp`, then it would unpack into :file:`C:\\"
"\\Temp\\\\foo-1.0`; you can use either an archive manipulator with a "
"graphical user interface (such as WinZip) or a command-line tool (such as :"
"program:`unzip` or :program:`pkunzip`) to unpack the archive.  Then, open a "
"command prompt window and run::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Splitting the job up"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Running ``setup.py install`` builds and installs all modules in one run.  If "
"you prefer to work incrementally---especially useful if you want to "
"customize the build process, or if things are going wrong---you can use the "
"setup script to do one thing at a time.  This is particularly helpful when "
"the build and install will be done by different users---for example, you "
"might want to build a module distribution and hand it off to a system "
"administrator for installation (or do it yourself, with super-user "
"privileges)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, you can build everything in one step, and then install "
"everything in a second step, by invoking the setup script twice::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you do this, you will notice that running the :command:`install` command "
"first runs the :command:`build` command, which---in this case---quickly "
"notices that it has nothing to do, since everything in the :file:`build` "
"directory is up-to-date."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You may not need this ability to break things down often if all you do is "
"install modules downloaded off the 'net, but it's very handy for more "
"advanced tasks.  If you get into distributing your own Python modules and "
"extensions, you'll run lots of individual Distutils commands on their own."
msgstr ""

msgid "How building works"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As implied above, the :command:`build` command is responsible for putting "
"the files to install into a *build directory*.  By default, this is :file:"
"`build` under the distribution root; if you're excessively concerned with "
"speed, or want to keep the source tree pristine, you can change the build "
"directory with the :option:`!--build-base` option. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"(Or you could do this permanently with a directive in your system or "
"personal Distutils configuration file; see section :ref:`inst-config-"
"files`.)  Normally, this isn't necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid "The default layout for the build tree is as follows::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"where ``<plat>`` expands to a brief description of the current OS/hardware "
"platform and Python version.  The first form, with just a :file:`lib` "
"directory, is used for \"pure module distributions\"---that is, module "
"distributions that include only pure Python modules.  If a module "
"distribution contains any extensions (modules written in C/C++), then the "
"second form, with two ``<plat>`` directories, is used.  In that case, the :"
"file:`temp.{plat}` directory holds temporary files generated by the compile/"
"link process that don't actually get installed.  In either case, the :file:"
"`lib` (or :file:`lib.{plat}`) directory contains all Python modules (pure "
"Python and extensions) that will be installed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the future, more directories will be added to handle Python scripts, "
"documentation, binary executables, and whatever else is needed to handle the "
"job of installing Python modules and applications."
msgstr ""

msgid "How installation works"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the :command:`build` command runs (whether you run it explicitly, or "
"the :command:`install` command does it for you), the work of the :command:"
"`install` command is relatively simple: all it has to do is copy everything "
"under :file:`build/lib` (or :file:`build/lib.{plat}`) to your chosen "
"installation directory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't choose an installation directory---i.e., if you just run "
"``setup.py install``\\ ---then the :command:`install` command installs to "
"the standard location for third-party Python modules.  This location varies "
"by platform and by how you built/installed Python itself.  On Unix (and "
"macOS, which is also Unix-based), it also depends on whether the module "
"distribution being installed is pure Python or contains extensions (\"non-"
"pure\"):"

"Most Linux distributions include Python as a standard part of the system, "
"so :file:`{prefix}` and :file:`{exec-prefix}` are usually both :file:`/usr` "
"on Linux.  If you build Python yourself on Linux (or any Unix-like system), "
"the default :file:`{prefix}` and :file:`{exec-prefix}` are :file:`/usr/"
"local`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default installation directory on Windows was :file:`C:\\\\Program "
"Files\\\\Python` under Python 1.6a1, 1.5.2, and earlier."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":file:`{prefix}` and :file:`{exec-prefix}` stand for the directories that "
"Python is installed to, and where it finds its libraries at run-time.  They "
"are always the same under Windows, and very often the same under Unix and "
"macOS.  You can find out what your Python installation uses for :file:"
"`{prefix}` and :file:`{exec-prefix}` by running Python in interactive mode "
"and typing a few simple commands. Under Unix, just type ``python`` at the "
"shell prompt.  Under Windows, choose :menuselection:`Start --> Programs --> "
"Python X.Y --> Python (command line)`.   Once the interpreter is started, "
"you type Python code at the prompt.  For example, on my Linux system, I type "
"the three Python statements shown below, and get the output as shown, to "
"find out my :file:`{prefix}` and :file:`{exec-prefix}`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A few other placeholders are used in this document: :file:`{X.Y}` stands for "
"the version of Python, for example ``3.2``; :file:`{abiflags}` will be "
"replaced by the value of :data:`sys.abiflags` or the empty string for "
"platforms which don't define ABI flags; :file:`{distname}` will be replaced "
"by the name of the module distribution being installed.  Dots and "
"capitalization are important in the paths; for example, a value that uses "
"``python3.2`` on UNIX will typically use ``Python32`` on Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't want to install modules to the standard location, or if you "
"don't have permission to write there, then you need to read about alternate "
"installations in section :ref:`inst-alt-install`.  If you want to customize "
"your installation directories more heavily, see section :ref:`inst-custom-"
"install` on custom installations."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alternate Installation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Often, it is necessary or desirable to install modules to a location other "
"than the standard location for third-party Python modules.  For example, on "
"a Unix system you might not have permission to write to the standard third-"
"party module directory.  Or you might wish to try out a module before making "
"it a standard part of your local Python installation.  This is especially "
"true when upgrading a distribution already present: you want to make sure "
"your existing base of scripts still works with the new version before "
"actually upgrading."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Distutils :command:`install` command is designed to make installing "
"module distributions to an alternate location simple and painless.  The "
"basic idea is that you supply a base directory for the installation, and "
"the :command:`install` command picks a set of directories (called an "
"*installation scheme*) under this base directory in which to install files.  "
"The details differ across platforms, so read whichever of the following "
"sections applies to you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that the various alternate installation schemes are mutually exclusive: "
"you can pass ``--user``, or ``--home``, or ``--prefix`` and ``--exec-"
"prefix``, or ``--install-base`` and ``--install-platbase``, but you can't "
"mix from these groups."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alternate installation: the user scheme"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This scheme is designed to be the most convenient solution for users that "
"don't have write permission to the global site-packages directory or don't "
"want to install into it.  It is enabled with a simple option::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Files will be installed into subdirectories of :data:`site.USER_BASE` "
"(written as :file:`{userbase}` hereafter).  This scheme installs pure Python "
"modules and extension modules in the same location (also known as :data:"

msgid ":file:`{userbase}\\\\Python{XY}\\\\Include\\\\{distname}`"

"The advantage of using this scheme compared to the other ones described "
"below is that the user site-packages directory is under normal conditions "
"always included in :data:`sys.path` (see :mod:`site` for more information), "
"which means that there is no additional step to perform after running the :"
"file:`setup.py` script to finalize the installation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :command:`build_ext` command also has a ``--user`` option to add :file:"
"`{userbase}/include` to the compiler search path for header files and :file:"
"`{userbase}/lib` to the compiler search path for libraries as well as to the "
"runtime search path for shared C libraries (rpath)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Alternate installation: the home scheme"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The idea behind the \"home scheme\" is that you build and maintain a "
"personal stash of Python modules.  This scheme's name is derived from the "
"idea of a \"home\" directory on Unix, since it's not unusual for a Unix user "
"to make their home directory have a layout similar to :file:`/usr/` or :file:"
"`/usr/local/`. This scheme can be used by anyone, regardless of the "
"operating system they are installing for."
msgstr ""

msgid "Installing a new module distribution is as simple as ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"where you can supply any directory you like for the :option:`!--home` "
"option.  On Unix, lazy typists can just type a tilde (``~``); the :command:"
"`install` command will expand this to your home directory::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To make Python find the distributions installed with this scheme, you may "
"have to :ref:`modify Python's search path <inst-search-path>` or edit :mod:"
"`sitecustomize` (see :mod:`site`) to call :func:`site.addsitedir` or edit :"
"data:`sys.path`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :option:`!--home` option defines the installation base directory.  Files "
"are installed to the following directories under the installation base as "
"follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":file:`{home}/lib/python`"
msgstr ""

msgid ":file:`{home}/bin`"
msgstr ""

msgid ":file:`{home}`"
msgstr ""

msgid ":file:`{home}/include/python/{distname}`"
msgstr ""

msgid "(Mentally replace slashes with backslashes if you're on Windows.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Alternate installation: Unix (the prefix scheme)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"prefix scheme\" is useful when you wish to use one Python installation "
"to perform the build/install (i.e., to run the setup script), but install "
"modules into the third-party module directory of a different Python "
"installation (or something that looks like a different Python "
"installation).  If this sounds a trifle unusual, it is---that's why the user "
"and home schemes come before.  However, there are at least two known cases "
"where the prefix scheme will be useful."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, consider that many Linux distributions put Python in :file:`/usr`, "
"rather than the more traditional :file:`/usr/local`.  This is entirely "
"appropriate, since in those cases Python is part of \"the system\" rather "
"than a local add-on. However, if you are installing Python modules from "
"source, you probably want them to go in :file:`/usr/local/lib/python2.{X}` "
"rather than :file:`/usr/lib/python2.{X}`.  This can be done with ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another possibility is a network filesystem where the name used to write to "
"a remote directory is different from the name used to read it: for example, "
"the Python interpreter accessed as :file:`/usr/local/bin/python` might "
"search for modules in :file:`/usr/local/lib/python2.{X}`, but those modules "
"would have to be installed to, say, :file:`/mnt/{@server}/export/lib/python2."
"{X}`.  This could be done with ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In either case, the :option:`!--prefix` option defines the installation "
"base, and the :option:`!--exec-prefix` option defines the platform-specific "
"installation base, which is used for platform-specific files.  (Currently, "
"this just means non-pure module distributions, but could be expanded to C "
"libraries, binary executables, etc.)  If :option:`!--exec-prefix` is not "
"supplied, it defaults to :option:`!--prefix`.  Files are installed as "
"follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Python modules"
msgstr ""

msgid "extension modules"

msgid ":file:`{prefix}/bin`"
msgstr ""

msgid ":file:`{prefix}`"
msgstr ""

msgid ":file:`{prefix}/include/python{X.Y}{abiflags}/{distname}`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is no requirement that :option:`!--prefix` or :option:`!--exec-prefix` "
"actually point to an alternate Python installation; if the directories "
"listed above do not already exist, they are created at installation time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Incidentally, the real reason the prefix scheme is important is simply that "
"a standard Unix installation uses the prefix scheme, but with :option:`!--"
"prefix` and :option:`!--exec-prefix` supplied by Python itself as ``sys."
"prefix`` and ``sys.exec_prefix``.  Thus, you might think you'll never use "
"the prefix scheme, but every time you run ``python setup.py install`` "
"without any other options, you're using it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that installing extensions to an alternate Python installation has no "
"effect on how those extensions are built: in particular, the Python header "
"files (:file:`Python.h` and friends) installed with the Python interpreter "
"used to run the setup script will be used in compiling extensions.  It is "
"your responsibility to ensure that the interpreter used to run extensions "
"installed in this way is compatible with the interpreter used to build "
"them.  The best way to do this is to ensure that the two interpreters are "
"the same version of Python (possibly different builds, or possibly copies of "
"the same build).  (Of course, if your :option:`!--prefix` and :option:`!--"
"exec-prefix` don't even point to an alternate Python installation, this is "
"immaterial.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Alternate installation: Windows (the prefix scheme)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Windows has no concept of a user's home directory, and since the standard "
"Python installation under Windows is simpler than under Unix, the :option:"
"`!--prefix` option has traditionally been used to install additional "
"packages in separate locations on Windows. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"to install modules to the :file:`\\\\Temp\\\\Python` directory on the "
"current drive."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The installation base is defined by the :option:`!--prefix` option; the :"
"option:`!--exec-prefix` option is not supported under Windows, which means "
"that pure Python modules and extension modules are installed into the same "
"location. Files are installed as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":file:`{prefix}\\\\Scripts`"
msgstr ""

msgid ":file:`{prefix}\\\\Include\\\\{distname}`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Custom Installation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes, the alternate installation schemes described in section :ref:"
"`inst-alt-install` just don't do what you want.  You might want to tweak "
"just one or two directories while keeping everything under the same base "
"directory, or you might want to completely redefine the installation "
"scheme.  In either case, you're creating a *custom installation scheme*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To create a custom installation scheme, you start with one of the alternate "
"schemes and override some of the installation directories used for the "
"various types of files, using these options:"

"These override options can be relative, absolute, or explicitly defined in "

"installation base directories, and they are normally the same---they only "
"differ when you use the Unix \"prefix scheme\" and supply different ``--"
"prefix`` and ``--exec-prefix`` options; using ``--install-lib`` will "
"override values computed or given for ``--install-purelib`` and ``--install-"
"platlib``, and is recommended for schemes that don't make a difference "
"between Python and extension modules.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, say you're installing a module distribution to your home "

"makes most sense to supply a relative path, which will be interpreted "
"relative to the installation base directory (your home directory, in this "
"case)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another Unix example: suppose your Python installation was built and "
"installed with a prefix of :file:`/usr/local/python`, so under a standard  "
"installation scripts will wind up in :file:`/usr/local/python/bin`.  If you "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"(This performs an installation using the \"prefix scheme\", where the prefix "
"is whatever your Python interpreter was installed with--- :file:`/usr/local/"
"python` in this case.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you maintain Python on Windows, you might want third-party modules to "
"live in a subdirectory of :file:`{prefix}`, rather than right in :file:"
"`{prefix}` itself.  This is almost as easy as customizing the script "
"installation directory---you just have to remember that there are two types "
"of modules to worry about, Python and extension modules, which can "
"conveniently be both controlled by one option::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The specified installation directory is relative to :file:`{prefix}`.  Of "
"course, you also have to ensure that this directory is in Python's module "
"search path, such as by putting a :file:`.pth` file in a site directory "
"(see :mod:`site`).  See section :ref:`inst-search-path` to find out how to "
"modify Python's search path."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to define an entire installation scheme, you just have to supply "
"all of the installation directory options.  The recommended way to do this "
"is to supply relative paths; for example, if you want to maintain all Python "
"module-related files under :file:`python` in your home directory, and you "
"want a separate directory for each platform that you use your home directory "
"from, you might define the following installation scheme::"
