msgid ":mod:`struct` --- Interpret bytes as packed binary data"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/struct.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module performs conversions between Python values and C structs "
"represented as Python :class:`bytes` objects.  This can be used in handling "
"binary data stored in files or from network connections, among other "
"sources.  It uses :ref:`struct-format-strings` as compact descriptions of "
"the layout of the C structs and the intended conversion to/from Python "
"values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, the result of packing a given C struct includes pad bytes in "
"order to maintain proper alignment for the C types involved; similarly, "
"alignment is taken into account when unpacking.  This behavior is chosen so "
"that the bytes of a packed struct correspond exactly to the layout in memory "
"of the corresponding C struct.  To handle platform-independent data formats "
"or omit implicit pad bytes, use ``standard`` size and alignment instead of "
"``native`` size and alignment: see :ref:`struct-alignment` for details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Several :mod:`struct` functions (and methods of :class:`Struct`) take a "
"*buffer* argument.  This refers to objects that implement the :ref:"
"`bufferobjects` and provide either a readable or read-writable buffer.  The "
"most common types used for that purpose are :class:`bytes` and :class:"
"`bytearray`, but many other types that can be viewed as an array of bytes "
"implement the buffer protocol, so that they can be read/filled without "
"additional copying from a :class:`bytes` object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Functions and Exceptions"
msgstr ""

msgid "The module defines the following exception and functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exception raised on various occasions; argument is a string describing what "
"is wrong."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a bytes object containing the values *v1*, *v2*, ... packed according "
"to the format string *format*.  The arguments must match the values required "
"by the format exactly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pack the values *v1*, *v2*, ... according to the format string *format* and "
"write the packed bytes into the writable buffer *buffer* starting at "
"position *offset*.  Note that *offset* is a required argument."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unpack from the buffer *buffer* (presumably packed by ``pack(format, ...)``) "
"according to the format string *format*.  The result is a tuple even if it "
"contains exactly one item.  The buffer's size in bytes must match the size "
"required by the format, as reflected by :func:`calcsize`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unpack from *buffer* starting at position *offset*, according to the format "
"string *format*.  The result is a tuple even if it contains exactly one "
"item.  The buffer's size in bytes, starting at position *offset*, must be at "
"least the size required by the format, as reflected by :func:`calcsize`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Iteratively unpack from the buffer *buffer* according to the format string "
"*format*.  This function returns an iterator which will read equally sized "

msgid "Format Strings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Format strings are the mechanism used to specify the expected layout when "
"packing and unpacking data.  They are built up from :ref:`format-"
"characters`, which specify the type of data being packed/unpacked.  In "
"addition, there are special characters for controlling the :ref:`struct-"
"alignment`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Byte Order, Size, and Alignment"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, C types are represented in the machine's native format and byte "
"order, and properly aligned by skipping pad bytes if necessary (according to "
"the rules used by the C compiler)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, the first character of the format string can be used to "
"indicate the byte order, size and alignment of the packed data, according to "
"the following table:"

msgstr ""

msgid "If the first character is not one of these, ``'@'`` is assumed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Native byte order is big-endian or little-endian, depending on the host "
"system. For example, Intel x86 and AMD64 (x86-64) are little-endian; IBM z "
"and most legacy architectures are big-endian; and ARM, RISC-V and IBM Power "
"feature switchable endianness (bi-endian, though the former two are nearly "
"always little-endian in practice). Use ``sys.byteorder`` to check the "
"endianness of your system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Native size and alignment are determined using the C compiler's ``sizeof`` "
"expression.  This is always combined with native byte order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Standard size depends only on the format character;  see the table in the :"
"ref:`format-characters` section."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note the difference between ``'@'`` and ``'='``: both use native byte order, "
"but the size and alignment of the latter is standardized."
msgstr ""

"The form ``'!'`` represents the network byte order which is always big-"
"endian as defined in `IETF RFC 1700 <IETF RFC 1700_>`_."

msgid ""
"Padding is only automatically added between successive structure members. No "
"padding is added at the beginning or the end of the encoded struct."

msgid ""
"No padding is added when using non-native size and alignment, e.g. with '<', "
"'>', '=', and '!'."

msgid "Format Characters"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Format characters have the following meaning; the conversion between C and "
"Python values should be obvious given their types.  The 'Standard size' "
"column refers to the size of the packed value in bytes when using standard "
"size; that is, when the format string starts with one of ``'<'``, ``'>'``, "
"``'!'`` or ``'='``.  When using native size, the size of the packed value is "

msgstr ""

"The ``'P'`` format character is only available for the native byte ordering "
"(selected as the default or with the ``'@'`` byte order character). The byte "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The IEEE 754 binary16 \"half precision\" type was introduced in the 2008 "
"revision of the `IEEE 754 standard <ieee 754 standard_>`_. It has a sign "
"bit, a 5-bit exponent and 11-bit precision (with 10 bits explicitly stored), "
"and can represent numbers between approximately ``6.1e-05`` and ``6.5e+04`` "
"at full precision. This type is not widely supported by C compilers: on a "
"typical machine, an unsigned short can be used for storage, but not for math "
"operations. See the Wikipedia page on the `half-precision floating-point "
"format <half precision format_>`_ for more information."

"A format character may be preceded by an integral repeat count.  For "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whitespace characters between formats are ignored; a count and its format "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the ``'s'`` format character, the count is interpreted as the length of "
"the bytes, not a repeat count like for the other format characters; for "
"example, ``'10s'`` means a single 10-byte string, while ``'10c'`` means 10 "
"characters. If a count is not given, it defaults to 1.  For packing, the "
"string is truncated or padded with null bytes as appropriate to make it fit. "
"For unpacking, the resulting bytes object always has exactly the specified "
"number of bytes.  As a special case, ``'0s'`` means a single, empty string "
"(while ``'0c'`` means 0 characters)."

"When packing a value ``x`` using one of the integer formats (``'b'``, "
"``'B'``, ``'h'``, ``'H'``, ``'i'``, ``'I'``, ``'l'``, ``'L'``, ``'q'``, "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``'p'`` format character encodes a \"Pascal string\", meaning a short "
"variable-length string stored in a *fixed number of bytes*, given by the "
"count. The first byte stored is the length of the string, or 255, whichever "
"is smaller.  The bytes of the string follow.  If the string passed in to :"
"func:`pack` is too long (longer than the count minus 1), only the leading "
"``count-1`` bytes of the string are stored.  If the string is shorter than "
"``count-1``, it is padded with null bytes so that exactly count bytes in all "
"are used.  Note that for :func:`unpack`, the ``'p'`` format character "
"consumes ``count`` bytes, but that the string returned can never contain "
"more than 255 bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the ``'?'`` format character, the return value is either :const:`True` "
"or :const:`False`. When packing, the truth value of the argument object is "
