msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module converts between Python values and C structs represented as "
"Python :class:`bytes` objects.  Compact :ref:`format strings <struct-format-"
"strings>` describe the intended conversions to/from Python values. The "
"module's functions and objects can be used for two largely distinct "
"applications, data exchange with external sources (files or network "
"connections), or data transfer between the Python application and the C "
"layer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When no prefix character is given, native mode is the default. It packs or "
"unpacks data based on the platform and compiler on which the Python "
"interpreter was built. The result of packing a given C struct includes pad "
"bytes which maintain proper alignment for the C types involved; similarly, "
"alignment is taken into account when unpacking.  In contrast, when "
"communicating data between external sources, the programmer is responsible "
"for defining byte ordering and padding between elements. See :ref:`struct-"
"alignment` for details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Several :mod:`struct` functions (and methods of :class:`Struct`) take a "
"*buffer* argument.  This refers to objects that implement the :ref:"
"`bufferobjects` and provide either a readable or read-writable buffer.  The "
"most common types used for that purpose are :class:`bytes` and :class:"
"`bytearray`, but many other types that can be viewed as an array of bytes "
"implement the buffer protocol, so that they can be read/filled without "
"additional copying from a :class:`bytes` object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Functions and Exceptions"
msgstr ""

msgid "The module defines the following exception and functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exception raised on various occasions; argument is a string describing what "
"is wrong."
msgstr ""

"Pack the values *v1*, *v2*, ... according to the format string *format* and "

msgid ""
"Unpack from the buffer *buffer* (presumably packed by ``pack(format, ...)``) "

msgid ""
"Unpack from *buffer* starting at position *offset*, according to the format "

"least the size required by the format, as reflected by :func:`calcsize`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Iteratively unpack from the buffer *buffer* according to the format string "

msgid "Format Strings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Format strings describe the data layout when packing and unpacking data.  "
"They are built up from :ref:`format characters<format-characters>`, which "
"specify the type of data being packed/unpacked.  In addition, special "
"characters control the :ref:`byte order, size and alignment<struct-"
"alignment>`. Each format string consists of an optional prefix character "
"which describes the overall properties of the data and one or more format "
"characters which describe the actual data values and padding."
msgstr ""

msgid "Byte Order, Size, and Alignment"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, C types are represented in the machine's native format and byte "
"order, and properly aligned by skipping pad bytes if necessary (according to "
"the rules used by the C compiler). This behavior is chosen so that the bytes "
"of a packed struct correspond exactly to the memory layout of the "
"corresponding C struct. Whether to use native byte ordering and padding or "
"standard formats depends on the application."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, the first character of the format string can be used to "
"indicate the byte order, size and alignment of the packed data, according to "
"the following table:"

"The IEEE 754 binary16 \"half precision\" type was introduced in the 2008 "

"and can represent numbers between approximately ``6.1e-05`` and ``6.5e+04`` "
"at full precision. This type is not widely supported by C compilers: on a "
"typical machine, an unsigned short can be used for storage, but not for math "
"operations. See the Wikipedia page on the `half-precision floating-point "
"format <half precision format_>`_ for more information."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``'p'`` format character encodes a \"Pascal string\", meaning a short "
"variable-length string stored in a *fixed number of bytes*, given by the "
"count. The first byte stored is the length of the string, or 255, whichever "
"is smaller.  The bytes of the string follow.  If the string passed in to :"
"func:`pack` is too long (longer than the count minus 1), only the leading "
"``count-1`` bytes of the string are stored.  If the string is shorter than "
"``count-1``, it is padded with null bytes so that exactly count bytes in all "
"are used.  Note that for :func:`unpack`, the ``'p'`` format character "
"consumes ``count`` bytes, but that the string returned can never contain "
"more than 255 bytes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the ``'s'`` format character, the count is interpreted as the length of "
"the bytes, not a repeat count like for the other format characters; for "
"example, ``'10s'`` means a single 10-byte string mapping to or from a single "
"Python byte string, while ``'10c'`` means 10 separate one byte character "
"elements (e.g., ``cccccccccc``) mapping to or from ten different Python byte "
"objects. (See :ref:`struct-examples` for a concrete demonstration of the "
"difference.) If a count is not given, it defaults to 1.  For packing, the "
"string is truncated or padded with null bytes as appropriate to make it fit. "
"For unpacking, the resulting bytes object always has exactly the specified "
"number of bytes.  As a special case, ``'0s'`` means a single, empty string "
"(while ``'0c'`` means 0 characters)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A format character may be preceded by an integral repeat count.  For "
"example, the format string ``'4h'`` means exactly the same as ``'hhhh'``."

msgid ""
"Whitespace characters between formats are ignored; a count and its format "
"must not contain whitespace though."

"When packing a value ``x`` using one of the integer formats (``'b'``, "
"``'B'``, ``'h'``, ``'H'``, ``'i'``, ``'I'``, ``'l'``, ``'L'``, ``'q'``, "
"``'Q'``), if ``x`` is outside the valid range for that format then :exc:"
"`struct.error` is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Previously, some of the integer formats wrapped out-of-range values and "
"raised :exc:`DeprecationWarning` instead of :exc:`struct.error`."

msgid "Applications"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two main applications for the :mod:`struct` module exist, data interchange "
"between Python and C code within an application or another application "
"compiled using the same compiler (:ref:`native formats<struct-native-"
"formats>`), and data interchange between applications using agreed upon data "
"layout (:ref:`standard formats<struct-standard-formats>`).  Generally "
"speaking, the format strings constructed for these two domains are distinct."
msgstr ""

msgid "Native Formats"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When constructing format strings which mimic native layouts, the compiler "
"and machine architecture determine byte ordering and padding. In such cases, "
"the ``@`` format character should be used to specify native byte ordering "
"and data sizes.  Internal pad bytes are normally inserted automatically.  It "
"is possible that a zero-repeat format code will be needed at the end of a "
"format string to round up to the correct byte boundary for proper alignment "
"of consecutive chunks of data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Consider these two simple examples (on a 64-bit, little-endian machine)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Data is not padded to an 8-byte boundary at the end of the second format "
"string without the use of extra padding.  A zero-repeat format code solves "
"that problem::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``'x'`` format code can be used to specify the repeat, but for native "
"formats it is better to use a zero-repeat format like ``'0l'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, native byte ordering and alignment is used, but it is better to "
"be explicit and use the ``'@'`` prefix character."
msgstr ""

msgid "Standard Formats"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When exchanging data beyond your process such as networking or storage, be "
"precise.  Specify the exact byte order, size, and alignment.  Do not assume "
"they match the native order of a particular machine. For example, network "
"byte order is big-endian, while many popular CPUs are little-endian.  By "
"defining this explicitly, the user need not care about the specifics of the "
"platform their code is running on. The first character should typically be "
"``<`` or ``>`` (or ``!``).  Padding is the responsibility of the "
"programmer.  The zero-repeat format character won't work.  Instead, the user "
"must explicitly add ``'x'`` pad bytes where needed.  Revisiting the examples "
"from the previous section, we have::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
