msgid ":mod:`smtpd` --- SMTP Server"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/smtpd.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid "This module offers several classes to implement SMTP (email) servers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`smtpd` module is deprecated (see :pep:`PEP 594 <594#smtpd>` for "
"details). The `aiosmtpd <https://aiosmtpd.readthedocs.io/>`_ package is a "
"recommended replacement for this module.  It is based on :mod:`asyncio` and "
"provides a more straightforward API."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Several server implementations are present; one is a generic do-nothing "
"implementation, which can be overridden, while the other two offer specific "
"mail-sending strategies."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally the SMTPChannel may be extended to implement very specific "
"interaction behaviour with SMTP clients."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The code supports :RFC:`5321`, plus the :rfc:`1870` SIZE and :rfc:`6531` "
"SMTPUTF8 extensions."
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`Availability <availability>`: not Emscripten, not WASI."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly platforms "
"``wasm32-emscripten`` and ``wasm32-wasi``. See :ref:`wasm-availability` for "
"more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "SMTPServer Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new :class:`SMTPServer` object, which binds to local address "
"*localaddr*.  It will treat *remoteaddr* as an upstream SMTP relayer.  Both "
"*localaddr* and *remoteaddr* should be a :ref:`(host, port) <host_port>` "
"tuple.  The object inherits from :class:`asyncore.dispatcher`, and so will "
"insert itself into :mod:`asyncore`'s event loop on instantiation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*data_size_limit* specifies the maximum number of bytes that will be "
"accepted in a ``DATA`` command.  A value of ``None`` or ``0`` means no limit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*map* is the socket map to use for connections (an initially empty "
"dictionary is a suitable value).  If not specified the :mod:`asyncore` "
"global socket map is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*enable_SMTPUTF8* determines whether the ``SMTPUTF8`` extension (as defined "
"in :RFC:`6531`) should be enabled.  The default is ``False``. When ``True``, "
"``SMTPUTF8`` is accepted as a parameter to the ``MAIL`` command and when "
"present is passed to :meth:`process_message` in the "
"``kwargs['mail_options']`` list.  *decode_data* and *enable_SMTPUTF8* cannot "
"be set to ``True`` at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*decode_data* specifies whether the data portion of the SMTP transaction "
"should be decoded using UTF-8.  When *decode_data* is ``False`` (the "
"default), the server advertises the ``8BITMIME`` extension (:rfc:`6152`), "
"accepts the ``BODY=8BITMIME`` parameter to the ``MAIL`` command, and when "
"present passes it to :meth:`process_message` in the "
"``kwargs['mail_options']`` list. *decode_data* and *enable_SMTPUTF8* cannot "
"be set to ``True`` at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raise a :exc:`NotImplementedError` exception. Override this in subclasses to "
"do something useful with this message. Whatever was passed in the "
"constructor as *remoteaddr* will be available as the :attr:`_remoteaddr` "
"attribute. *peer* is the remote host's address, *mailfrom* is the envelope "
"originator, *rcpttos* are the envelope recipients and *data* is a string "
"containing the contents of the e-mail (which should be in :rfc:`5321` "
"format)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the *decode_data* constructor keyword is set to ``True``, the *data* "
"argument will be a unicode string.  If it is set to ``False``, it will be a "
"bytes object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*kwargs* is a dictionary containing additional information. It is empty if "
"``decode_data=True`` was given as an init argument, otherwise it contains "
"the following keys:"
msgstr ""

msgid "*mail_options*:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"a list of all received parameters to the ``MAIL`` command (the elements are "
"uppercase strings; example: ``['BODY=8BITMIME', 'SMTPUTF8']``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "*rcpt_options*:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"same as *mail_options* but for the ``RCPT`` command. Currently no ``RCPT "
"TO`` options are supported, so for now this will always be an empty list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Implementations of ``process_message`` should use the ``**kwargs`` signature "
"to accept arbitrary keyword arguments, since future feature enhancements may "
"add keys to the kwargs dictionary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``None`` to request a normal ``250 Ok`` response; otherwise return "
"the desired response string in :RFC:`5321` format."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Override this in subclasses to use a custom :class:`SMTPChannel` for "
"managing SMTP clients."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *map* constructor argument."
msgstr ""

msgid "*localaddr* and *remoteaddr* may now contain IPv6 addresses."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *decode_data* and *enable_SMTPUTF8* constructor parameters, and the "
"*kwargs* parameter to :meth:`process_message` when *decode_data* is "
"``False``."
msgstr ""

msgid "*decode_data* is now ``False`` by default."
msgstr ""

msgid "DebuggingServer Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new debugging server.  Arguments are as per :class:`SMTPServer`. "
"Messages will be discarded, and printed on stdout."
msgstr ""

msgid "PureProxy Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new pure proxy server. Arguments are as per :class:`SMTPServer`. "
"Everything will be relayed to *remoteaddr*.  Note that running this has a "
"good chance to make you into an open relay, so please be careful."
msgstr ""

msgid "SMTPChannel Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new :class:`SMTPChannel` object which manages the communication "
"between the server and a single SMTP client."
msgstr ""

msgid "*conn* and *addr* are as per the instance variables described below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*enable_SMTPUTF8* determines whether the ``SMTPUTF8`` extension (as defined "
"in :RFC:`6531`) should be enabled.  The default is ``False``. *decode_data* "
"and *enable_SMTPUTF8* cannot be set to ``True`` at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A dictionary can be specified in *map* to avoid using a global socket map."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*decode_data* specifies whether the data portion of the SMTP transaction "
"should be decoded using UTF-8.  The default is ``False``. *decode_data* and "
"*enable_SMTPUTF8* cannot be set to ``True`` at the same time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To use a custom SMTPChannel implementation you need to override the :attr:"
"`SMTPServer.channel_class` of your :class:`SMTPServer`."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *decode_data* and *enable_SMTPUTF8* parameters were added."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :class:`SMTPChannel` has the following instance variables:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Holds the :class:`SMTPServer` that spawned this channel."
msgstr ""

"Holds a list of the line strings (decoded using UTF-8) received from the "
"client. The lines have their ``\"\\r\\n\"`` line ending translated to "
"``\"\\n\"``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Holds the current state of the channel. This will be either :attr:`COMMAND` "
"initially and then :attr:`DATA` after the client sends a \"DATA\" line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Holds a string containing the greeting sent by the client in its \"HELO\"."

"from the client."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Holds a list of strings containing the addresses identified in the \"RCPT TO:"

msgid ""
"Holds the name of the client peer as returned by ``conn.getpeername()`` "
"where ``conn`` is :attr:`conn`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`SMTPChannel` operates by invoking methods named "
"``smtp_<command>`` upon reception of a command line from the client. Built "
"into the base :class:`SMTPChannel` class are methods for handling the "
"following commands (and responding to them appropriately):"
msgstr ""
