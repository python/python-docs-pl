msgid ":mod:`numbers` --- Numeric abstract base classes"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/numbers.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`numbers` module (:pep:`3141`) defines a hierarchy of numeric :term:"
"`abstract base classes <abstract base class>` which progressively define "
"more operations.  None of the types defined in this module are intended to "
"be instantiated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The root of the numeric hierarchy. If you just want to check if an argument "
"*x* is a number, without caring what kind, use ``isinstance(x, Number)``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The numeric tower"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subclasses of this type describe complex numbers and include the operations "
"that work on the built-in :class:`complex` type. These are: conversions to :"
"class:`complex` and :class:`bool`, :attr:`.real`, :attr:`.imag`, ``+``, ``-"
"``, ``*``, ``/``, ``**``, :func:`abs`, :meth:`conjugate`, ``==``, and ``!"
"=``. All except ``-`` and ``!=`` are abstract."
msgstr ""

msgid "Abstract. Retrieves the real component of this number."
msgstr ""

msgid "Abstract. Retrieves the imaginary component of this number."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Abstract. Returns the complex conjugate. For example, ``(1+3j).conjugate() "
"== (1-3j)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To :class:`Complex`, :class:`Real` adds the operations that work on real "
"numbers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In short, those are: a conversion to :class:`float`, :func:`math.trunc`, :"
"func:`round`, :func:`math.floor`, :func:`math.ceil`, :func:`divmod`, ``//``, "
"``%``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, and ``>=``."

"Real also provides defaults for :func:`complex`, :attr:`~Complex.real`, :"
"attr:`~Complex.imag`, and :meth:`~Complex.conjugate`."

msgid ""
"Subtypes :class:`Real` and adds :attr:`~Rational.numerator` and :attr:"
"`~Rational.denominator` properties. It also provides a default for :func:"
"`float`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :attr:`~Rational.numerator` and :attr:`~Rational.denominator` values "
"should be instances of :class:`Integral` and should be in lowest terms with :"
"attr:`~Rational.denominator` positive."

msgid "Abstract."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subtypes :class:`Rational` and adds a conversion to :class:`int`.  Provides "
"defaults for :func:`float`, :attr:`~Rational.numerator`, and :attr:"
"`~Rational.denominator`.  Adds abstract methods for :func:`pow` with modulus "
"and bit-string operations: ``<<``, ``>>``, ``&``, ``^``, ``|``, ``~``."

msgid "Notes for type implementors"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Implementors should be careful to make equal numbers equal and hash them to "
"the same values. This may be subtle if there are two different extensions of "
"the real numbers. For example, :class:`fractions.Fraction` implements :func:"
"`hash` as follows::"

msgid "Adding More Numeric ABCs"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are, of course, more possible ABCs for numbers, and this would be a "
"poor hierarchy if it precluded the possibility of adding those. You can add "
"``MyFoo`` between :class:`Complex` and :class:`Real` with::"

msgid "Implementing the arithmetic operations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We want to implement the arithmetic operations so that mixed-mode operations "
"either call an implementation whose author knew about the types of both "
"arguments, or convert both to the nearest built in type and do the operation "
"there. For subtypes of :class:`Integral`, this means that :meth:`__add__` "
"and :meth:`__radd__` should be defined as::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are 5 different cases for a mixed-type operation on subclasses of :"
"class:`Complex`. I'll refer to all of the above code that doesn't refer to "
"``MyIntegral`` and ``OtherTypeIKnowAbout`` as \"boilerplate\". ``a`` will be "
"an instance of ``A``, which is a subtype of :class:`Complex` (``a : A <: "
"Complex``), and ``b : B <: Complex``. I'll consider ``a + b``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "If ``A`` defines an :meth:`__add__` which accepts ``b``, all is well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``A`` falls back to the boilerplate code, and it were to return a value "
"from :meth:`__add__`, we'd miss the possibility that ``B`` defines a more "
"intelligent :meth:`__radd__`, so the boilerplate should return :const:"
"`NotImplemented` from :meth:`__add__`. (Or ``A`` may not implement :meth:"
"`__add__` at all.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Then ``B``'s :meth:`__radd__` gets a chance. If it accepts ``a``, all is "
"well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If it falls back to the boilerplate, there are no more possible methods to "
"try, so this is where the default implementation should live."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``B <: A``, Python tries ``B.__radd__`` before ``A.__add__``. This is ok, "
"because it was implemented with knowledge of ``A``, so it can handle those "
"instances before delegating to :class:`Complex`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``A <: Complex`` and ``B <: Real`` without sharing any other knowledge, "
"then the appropriate shared operation is the one involving the built in :"
"class:`complex`, and both :meth:`__radd__` s land there, so ``a+b == b+a``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because most of the operations on any given type will be very similar, it "
"can be useful to define a helper function which generates the forward and "
"reverse instances of any given operator. For example, :class:`fractions."
"Fraction` uses::"
