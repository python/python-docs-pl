msgid ":mod:`unittest.mock` --- mock object library"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/unittest/mock.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":mod:`unittest.mock` is a library for testing in Python. It allows you to "
"replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and make "
"assertions about how they have been used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":mod:`unittest.mock` provides a core :class:`Mock` class removing the need "
"to create a host of stubs throughout your test suite. After performing an "
"action, you can make assertions about which methods / attributes were used "
"and arguments they were called with. You can also specify return values and "
"set needed attributes in the normal way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, mock provides a :func:`patch` decorator that handles patching "
"module and class level attributes within the scope of a test, along with :"
"const:`sentinel` for creating unique objects. See the `quick guide`_ for "
"some examples of how to use :class:`Mock`, :class:`MagicMock` and :func:"
"`patch`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mock is designed for use with :mod:`unittest` and is based on the 'action -> "
"assertion' pattern instead of 'record -> replay' used by many mocking "
"frameworks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is a backport of :mod:`unittest.mock` for earlier versions of Python, "
"available as `mock on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/mock>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Quick Guide"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`Mock` and :class:`MagicMock` objects create all attributes and "
"methods as you access them and store details of how they have been used. You "
"can configure them, to specify return values or limit what attributes are "
"available, and then make assertions about how they have been used:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":attr:`side_effect` allows you to perform side effects, including raising an "
"exception when a mock is called:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mock has many other ways you can configure it and control its behaviour. For "
"example the *spec* argument configures the mock to take its specification "
"from another object. Attempting to access attributes or methods on the mock "
"that don't exist on the spec will fail with an :exc:`AttributeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`patch` decorator / context manager makes it easy to mock classes "
"or objects in a module under test. The object you specify will be replaced "
"with a mock (or other object) during the test and restored when the test "
"ends::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When you nest patch decorators the mocks are passed in to the decorated "
"function in the same order they applied (the normal *Python* order that "
"decorators are applied). This means from the bottom up, so in the example "
"above the mock for ``module.ClassName1`` is passed in first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With :func:`patch` it matters that you patch objects in the namespace where "
"they are looked up. This is normally straightforward, but for a quick guide "
"read :ref:`where to patch <where-to-patch>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As well as a decorator :func:`patch` can be used as a context manager in a "
"with statement:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is also :func:`patch.dict` for setting values in a dictionary just "
"during a scope and restoring the dictionary to its original state when the "
"test ends:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mock supports the mocking of Python :ref:`magic methods <magic-methods>`. "
"The easiest way of using magic methods is with the :class:`MagicMock` class. "
"It allows you to do things like:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mock allows you to assign functions (or other Mock instances) to magic "
"methods and they will be called appropriately. The :class:`MagicMock` class "
"is just a Mock variant that has all of the magic methods pre-created for you "
"(well, all the useful ones anyway)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following is an example of using magic methods with the ordinary Mock "
"class:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For ensuring that the mock objects in your tests have the same api as the "
"objects they are replacing, you can use :ref:`auto-speccing <auto-"
"speccing>`. Auto-speccing can be done through the *autospec* argument to "
"patch, or the :func:`create_autospec` function. Auto-speccing creates mock "
"objects that have the same attributes and methods as the objects they are "
"replacing, and any functions and methods (including constructors) have the "
"same call signature as the real object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This ensures that your mocks will fail in the same way as your production "
"code if they are used incorrectly:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`create_autospec` can also be used on classes, where it copies the "
"signature of the ``__init__`` method, and on callable objects where it "
"copies the signature of the ``__call__`` method."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Mock Class"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`Mock` is a flexible mock object intended to replace the use of stubs "
"and test doubles throughout your code. Mocks are callable and create "
"attributes as new mocks when you access them [#]_. Accessing the same "
"attribute will always return the same mock. Mocks record how you use them, "
"allowing you to make assertions about what your code has done to them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`MagicMock` is a subclass of :class:`Mock` with all the magic methods "
"pre-created and ready to use. There are also non-callable variants, useful "
"when you are mocking out objects that aren't callable: :class:"
"`NonCallableMock` and :class:`NonCallableMagicMock`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`patch` decorators makes it easy to temporarily replace classes in "
"a particular module with a :class:`Mock` object. By default :func:`patch` "
"will create a :class:`MagicMock` for you. You can specify an alternative "
"class of :class:`Mock` using the *new_callable* argument to :func:`patch`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a new :class:`Mock` object. :class:`Mock` takes several optional "
"arguments that specify the behaviour of the Mock object:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*spec*: This can be either a list of strings or an existing object (a class "
"or instance) that acts as the specification for the mock object. If you pass "
"in an object then a list of strings is formed by calling dir on the object "
"(excluding unsupported magic attributes and methods). Accessing any "
"attribute not in this list will raise an :exc:`AttributeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *spec* is an object (rather than a list of strings) then :attr:`~instance."
"__class__` returns the class of the spec object. This allows mocks to pass :"
"func:`isinstance` tests."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*spec_set*: A stricter variant of *spec*. If used, attempting to *set* or "
"get an attribute on the mock that isn't on the object passed as *spec_set* "
"will raise an :exc:`AttributeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*side_effect*: A function to be called whenever the Mock is called. See the :"
"attr:`~Mock.side_effect` attribute. Useful for raising exceptions or "
"dynamically changing return values. The function is called with the same "
"arguments as the mock, and unless it returns :data:`DEFAULT`, the return "
"value of this function is used as the return value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively *side_effect* can be an exception class or instance. In this "
"case the exception will be raised when the mock is called."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *side_effect* is an iterable then each call to the mock will return the "
"next value from the iterable."
msgstr ""

msgid "A *side_effect* can be cleared by setting it to ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*return_value*: The value returned when the mock is called. By default this "
"is a new Mock (created on first access). See the :attr:`return_value` "
"attribute."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*unsafe*: By default, accessing any attribute whose name starts with "
"*assert*, *assret*, *asert*, *aseert* or *assrt* will raise an :exc:"
"`AttributeError`. Passing ``unsafe=True`` will allow access to these "
"attributes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*wraps*: Item for the mock object to wrap. If *wraps* is not ``None`` then "
"calling the Mock will pass the call through to the wrapped object (returning "
"the real result). Attribute access on the mock will return a Mock object "
"that wraps the corresponding attribute of the wrapped object (so attempting "
"to access an attribute that doesn't exist will raise an :exc:"
"`AttributeError`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the mock has an explicit *return_value* set then calls are not passed to "
"the wrapped object and the *return_value* is returned instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*name*: If the mock has a name then it will be used in the repr of the mock. "
"This can be useful for debugging. The name is propagated to child mocks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mocks can also be called with arbitrary keyword arguments. These will be "
"used to set attributes on the mock after it is created. See the :meth:"
"`configure_mock` method for details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Assert that the mock was called at least once."
msgstr ""

msgid "Assert that the mock was called exactly once."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is a convenient way of asserting that the last call has been "
"made in a particular way:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Assert that the mock was called exactly once and that call was with the "
"specified arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid "assert the mock has been called with the specified arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The assert passes if the mock has *ever* been called, unlike :meth:"
"`assert_called_with` and :meth:`assert_called_once_with` that only pass if "
"the call is the most recent one, and in the case of :meth:"
"`assert_called_once_with` it must also be the only call."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"assert the mock has been called with the specified calls. The :attr:"
"`mock_calls` list is checked for the calls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *any_order* is false then the calls must be sequential. There can be "
"extra calls before or after the specified calls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *any_order* is true then the calls can be in any order, but they must all "
"appear in :attr:`mock_calls`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Assert the mock was never called."
msgstr ""

msgid "The reset_mock method resets all the call attributes on a mock object:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Added two keyword-only arguments to the reset_mock function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This can be useful where you want to make a series of assertions that reuse "
"the same object. Note that :meth:`reset_mock` *doesn't* clear the return "
"value, :attr:`side_effect` or any child attributes you have set using normal "
"assignment by default. In case you want to reset *return_value* or :attr:"
"`side_effect`, then pass the corresponding parameter as ``True``. Child "
"mocks and the return value mock (if any) are reset as well."
msgstr ""

msgid "*return_value*, and :attr:`side_effect` are keyword-only arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add a spec to a mock. *spec* can either be an object or a list of strings. "
"Only attributes on the *spec* can be fetched as attributes from the mock."
msgstr ""

msgid "If *spec_set* is true then only attributes on the spec can be set."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Attach a mock as an attribute of this one, replacing its name and parent. "
"Calls to the attached mock will be recorded in the :attr:`method_calls` and :"
"attr:`mock_calls` attributes of this one."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set attributes on the mock through keyword arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Attributes plus return values and side effects can be set on child mocks "
"using standard dot notation and unpacking a dictionary in the method call:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The same thing can be achieved in the constructor call to mocks:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`configure_mock` exists to make it easier to do configuration after "
"the mock has been created."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`Mock` objects limit the results of ``dir(some_mock)`` to useful "
"results. For mocks with a *spec* this includes all the permitted attributes "
"for the mock."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See :data:`FILTER_DIR` for what this filtering does, and how to switch it "
"off."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create the child mocks for attributes and return value. By default child "
"mocks will be the same type as the parent. Subclasses of Mock may want to "
"override this to customize the way child mocks are made."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For non-callable mocks the callable variant will be used (rather than any "
"custom subclass)."
msgstr ""

msgid "A boolean representing whether or not the mock object has been called:"
msgstr ""

msgid "An integer telling you how many times the mock object has been called:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Set this to configure the value returned by calling the mock:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default return value is a mock object and you can configure it in the "
"normal way:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":attr:`return_value` can also be set in the constructor:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This can either be a function to be called when the mock is called, an "
"iterable or an exception (class or instance) to be raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you pass in a function it will be called with same arguments as the mock "
"and unless the function returns the :data:`DEFAULT` singleton the call to "
"the mock will then return whatever the function returns. If the function "
"returns :data:`DEFAULT` then the mock will return its normal value (from "
"the :attr:`return_value`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you pass in an iterable, it is used to retrieve an iterator which must "
"yield a value on every call.  This value can either be an exception instance "
"to be raised, or a value to be returned from the call to the mock (:data:"
"`DEFAULT` handling is identical to the function case)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An example of a mock that raises an exception (to test exception handling of "
"an API):"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using :attr:`side_effect` to return a sequence of values:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Using a callable:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":attr:`side_effect` can be set in the constructor. Here's an example that "
"adds one to the value the mock is called with and returns it:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Setting :attr:`side_effect` to ``None`` clears it:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is either ``None`` (if the mock hasn't been called), or the arguments "
"that the mock was last called with. This will be in the form of a tuple: the "
"first member, which can also be accessed through the ``args`` property, is "

msgid ""
":attr:`call_args`, along with members of the lists :attr:`call_args_list`, :"
"attr:`method_calls` and :attr:`mock_calls` are :data:`call` objects. These "
"are tuples, so they can be unpacked to get at the individual arguments and "
"make more complex assertions. See :ref:`calls as tuples <calls-as-tuples>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added ``args`` and ``kwargs`` properties."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a list of all the calls made to the mock object in sequence (so the "

"The way :attr:`mock_calls` are recorded means that where nested calls are "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally the :attr:`__class__` attribute of an object will return its type. "
"For a mock object with a :attr:`spec`, ``__class__`` returns the spec class "
"instead. This allows mock objects to pass :func:`isinstance` tests for the "

"The return value and side effect of child mocks can be set in the same way, "

"A callable mock which was created with a *spec* (or a *spec_set*) will "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`Mock` is a very powerful and flexible object, but it suffers from "
"two flaws when used to mock out objects from a system under test. One of "
"these flaws is specific to the :class:`Mock` api and the other is a more "
"general problem with using mock objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First the problem specific to :class:`Mock`. :class:`Mock` has two assert "
"methods that are extremely handy: :meth:`~Mock.assert_called_with` and :meth:"
"`~Mock.assert_called_once_with`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because mocks auto-create attributes on demand, and allow you to call them "
"with arbitrary arguments, if you misspell one of these assert methods then "
"your assertion is gone:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Your tests can pass silently and incorrectly because of the typo."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second issue is more general to mocking. If you refactor some of your "
"code, rename members and so on, any tests for code that is still using the "
"*old api* but uses mocks instead of the real objects will still pass. This "
"means your tests can all pass even though your code is broken."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that this is another reason why you need integration tests as well as "
"unit tests. Testing everything in isolation is all fine and dandy, but if "
"you don't test how your units are \"wired together\" there is still lots of "
"room for bugs that tests might have caught."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":mod:`mock` already provides a feature to help with this, called speccing. "
"If you use a class or instance as the :attr:`spec` for a mock then you can "
"only access attributes on the mock that exist on the real class:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The spec only applies to the mock itself, so we still have the same issue "
"with any methods on the mock:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Auto-speccing solves this problem. You can either pass ``autospec=True`` to :"
"func:`patch` / :func:`patch.object` or use the :func:`create_autospec` "
"function to create a mock with a spec. If you use the ``autospec=True`` "
"argument to :func:`patch` then the object that is being replaced will be "
"used as the spec object. Because the speccing is done \"lazily\" (the spec "
"is created as attributes on the mock are accessed) you can use it with very "
"complex or deeply nested objects (like modules that import modules that "
"import modules) without a big performance hit."

"instantiating our mocked out :class:`request.Request` is a non-callable "
"mock. With the spec in place any typos in our asserts will raise the correct "
"error::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In many cases you will just be able to add ``autospec=True`` to your "
"existing :func:`patch` calls and then be protected against bugs due to typos "
"and api changes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As well as using *autospec* through :func:`patch` there is a :func:"
"`create_autospec` for creating autospecced mocks directly:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This isn't without caveats and limitations however, which is why it is not "
"the default behaviour. In order to know what attributes are available on the "
"spec object, autospec has to introspect (access attributes) the spec. As you "
"traverse attributes on the mock a corresponding traversal of the original "
"object is happening under the hood. If any of your specced objects have "
"properties or descriptors that can trigger code execution then you may not "
"be able to use autospec. On the other hand it is much better to design your "
"objects so that introspection is safe [#]_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A more serious problem is that it is common for instance attributes to be "
"created in the :meth:`__init__` method and not to exist on the class at all. "
"*autospec* can't know about any dynamically created attributes and restricts "
"the api to visible attributes. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are a few different ways of resolving this problem. The easiest, but "
"not necessarily the least annoying, way is to simply set the required "
"attributes on the mock after creation. Just because *autospec* doesn't allow "
"you to fetch attributes that don't exist on the spec it doesn't prevent you "
"setting them::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is a more aggressive version of both *spec* and *autospec* that *does* "
"prevent you setting non-existent attributes. This is useful if you want to "
"ensure your code only *sets* valid attributes too, but obviously it prevents "
"this particular scenario:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Probably the best way of solving the problem is to add class attributes as "
"default values for instance members initialised in :meth:`__init__`. Note "
"that if you are only setting default attributes in :meth:`__init__` then "
"providing them via class attributes (shared between instances of course) is "
"faster too. e.g."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This brings up another issue. It is relatively common to provide a default "
"value of ``None`` for members that will later be an object of a different "
"type. ``None`` would be useless as a spec because it wouldn't let you access "
"*any* attributes or methods on it. As ``None`` is *never* going to be useful "
"as a spec, and probably indicates a member that will normally of some other "
"type, autospec doesn't use a spec for members that are set to ``None``. "
"These will just be ordinary mocks (well - MagicMocks):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If modifying your production classes to add defaults isn't to your liking "
"then there are more options. One of these is simply to use an instance as "
"the spec rather than the class. The other is to create a subclass of the "
"production class and add the defaults to the subclass without affecting the "
"production class. Both of these require you to use an alternative object as "
"the spec. Thankfully :func:`patch` supports this - you can simply pass the "
"alternative object as the *autospec* argument::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
