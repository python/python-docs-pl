"This module provides access to mathematical functions for complex numbers.  "
"The functions in this module accept integers, floating-point numbers or "
"complex numbers as arguments. They will also accept any Python object that "
"has either a :meth:`__complex__` or a :meth:`__float__` method: these "
"methods are used to convert the object to a complex or floating-point "
"number, respectively, and the function is then applied to the result of the "
"conversion."

"Ten moduł zapewnia dostęp do funkcji matematycznych dla liczb zespolonych. "
"Funkcje w tym module akceptują liczby całkowite, liczby zmiennoprzecinkowe "
"lub liczby zespolone jako argumenty. Funkcje w tym module zaakceptują "
"również obiekty Python które zawierają metody :meth:`__complex__` lub :meth:"
"`__float__`: te metody są używane do konwertowania obiektów do liczb "
"zmiennoprzecinkowych lub zespolonych, odpowiednio, a funkcje używają później "
"wyników konwersji."

"For functions involving branch cuts, we have the problem of deciding how to "
"define those functions on the cut itself. Following Kahan's \"Branch cuts "
"for complex elementary functions\" paper, as well as Annex G of C99 and "
"later C standards, we use the sign of zero to distinguish one side of the "
"branch cut from the other: for a branch cut along (a portion of) the real "
"axis we look at the sign of the imaginary part, while for a branch cut along "
"the imaginary axis we look at the sign of the real part."

"For example, the :func:`cmath.sqrt` function has a branch cut along the "
"negative real axis. An argument of ``complex(-2.0, -0.0)`` is treated as "
"though it lies *below* the branch cut, and so gives a result on the negative "
"imaginary axis::"

"*Polar coordinates* give an alternative way to represent a complex number.  "
"In polar coordinates, a complex number *z* is defined by the modulus *r* and "
"the phase angle *phi*. The modulus *r* is the distance from *z* to the "

"return a complex number. Also note that the functions defined in :mod:"
