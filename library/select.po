"This is a straightforward interface to the Unix :c:func:`select` system "

"Empty iterables are allowed, but acceptance of three empty iterables is "
"platform-dependent. (It is known to work on Unix but not on Windows.)  The "
"optional *timeout* argument specifies a time-out as a floating point number "
"in seconds.  When the *timeout* argument is omitted the function blocks "
"until at least one file descriptor is ready.  A time-out value of zero "
"specifies a poll and never blocks."

"objects <file object>` (e.g. ``sys.stdin``, or objects returned by :func:"
"`open` or :func:`os.popen`), socket objects returned by :func:`socket."
"socket`.  You may also define a :dfn:`wrapper` class yourself, as long as it "

"file descriptor, not just a random integer)."

"File objects on Windows are not acceptable, but sockets are.  On Windows, "
