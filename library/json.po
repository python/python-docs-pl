"``None``) will be skipped instead of raising a :exc:`TypeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`json` module always produces :class:`str` objects, not :class:"

"If *check_circular* is false (default: ``True``), then the circular "
"reference check for container types will be skipped and a circular reference "

"simplicity, :class:`JSONEncoder` and :class:`JSONDecoder` subclasses, and "
"parameters other than those explicitly mentioned, are not considered."

"This module does not comply with the RFC in a strict fashion, implementing "
"some extensions that are valid JavaScript but not valid JSON.  In particular:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Infinite and NaN number values are accepted and output;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Repeated names within an object are accepted, and only the value of the last "
"name-value pair is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since the RFC permits RFC-compliant parsers to accept input texts that are "
"not RFC-compliant, this module's deserializer is technically RFC-compliant "
"under default settings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Character Encodings"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The RFC requires that JSON be represented using either UTF-8, UTF-16, or "
"UTF-32, with UTF-8 being the recommended default for maximum "
"interoperability."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As permitted, though not required, by the RFC, this module's serializer sets "
"*ensure_ascii=True* by default, thus escaping the output so that the "
"resulting strings only contain ASCII characters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Other than the *ensure_ascii* parameter, this module is defined strictly in "
"terms of conversion between Python objects and :class:`Unicode strings "
"<str>`, and thus does not otherwise directly address the issue of character "
"encodings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The RFC prohibits adding a byte order mark (BOM) to the start of a JSON "
"text, and this module's serializer does not add a BOM to its output. The RFC "
"permits, but does not require, JSON deserializers to ignore an initial BOM "
"in their input.  This module's deserializer raises a :exc:`ValueError` when "
"an initial BOM is present."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The RFC does not explicitly forbid JSON strings which contain byte sequences "
"that don't correspond to valid Unicode characters (e.g. unpaired UTF-16 "
"surrogates), but it does note that they may cause interoperability problems. "
"By default, this module accepts and outputs (when present in the original :"
"class:`str`) code points for such sequences."
msgstr ""

msgid "Infinite and NaN Number Values"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The RFC does not permit the representation of infinite or NaN number values. "

"In the serializer, the *allow_nan* parameter can be used to alter this "
"behavior.  In the deserializer, the *parse_constant* parameter can be used "
"to alter this behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid "Repeated Names Within an Object"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The RFC specifies that the names within a JSON object should be unique, but "
"does not mandate how repeated names in JSON objects should be handled.  By "
"default, this module does not raise an exception; instead, it ignores all "
"but the last name-value pair for a given name::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The *object_pairs_hook* parameter can be used to alter this behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid "Top-level Non-Object, Non-Array Values"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The old version of JSON specified by the obsolete :rfc:`4627` required that "
"the top-level value of a JSON text must be either a JSON object or array "
"(Python :class:`dict` or :class:`list`), and could not be a JSON null, "
"boolean, number, or string value.  :rfc:`7159` removed that restriction, and "

"This module does not impose any such limits beyond those of the relevant "
"Python datatypes themselves or the Python interpreter itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When serializing to JSON, beware any such limitations in applications that "
"may consume your JSON.  In particular, it is common for JSON numbers to be "
"deserialized into IEEE 754 double precision numbers and thus subject to that "
"representation's range and precision limitations.  This is especially "
