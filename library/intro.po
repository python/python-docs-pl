msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Wprowadzenie"

msgid "The \"Python library\" contains several different kinds of components."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It contains data types that would normally be considered part of the "
"\"core\" of a language, such as numbers and lists.  For these types, the "
"Python language core defines the form of literals and places some "
"constraints on their semantics, but does not fully define the semantics.  "
"(On the other hand, the language core does define syntactic properties like "
"the spelling and priorities of operators.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The library also contains built-in functions and exceptions --- objects that "
"can be used by all Python code without the need of an :keyword:`import` "
"statement. Some of these are defined by the core language, but many are not "
"essential for the core semantics and are only described here."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The bulk of the library, however, consists of a collection of modules. There "
"are many ways to dissect this collection.  Some modules are written in C and "
"built in to the Python interpreter; others are written in Python and "
"imported in source form.  Some modules provide interfaces that are highly "
"specific to Python, like printing a stack trace; some provide interfaces "
"that are specific to particular operating systems, such as access to "
"specific hardware; others provide interfaces that are specific to a "
"particular application domain, like the World Wide Web. Some modules are "
"available in all versions and ports of Python; others are only available "
"when the underlying system supports or requires them; yet others are "
"available only when a particular configuration option was chosen at the time "
"when Python was compiled and installed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This manual is organized \"from the inside out:\" it first describes the "
"built-in functions, data types and exceptions, and finally the modules, "
"grouped in chapters of related modules."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This means that if you start reading this manual from the start, and skip to "
"the next chapter when you get bored, you will get a reasonable overview of "
"the available modules and application areas that are supported by the Python "
"library.  Of course, you don't *have* to read it like a novel --- you can "
"also browse the table of contents (in front of the manual), or look for a "
"specific function, module or term in the index (in the back).  And finally, "
"if you enjoy learning about random subjects, you choose a random page number "
"(see module :mod:`random`) and read a section or two.  Regardless of the "
"order in which you read the sections of this manual, it helps to start with "
"chapter :ref:`built-in-funcs`, as the remainder of the manual assumes "
"familiarity with this material."
msgstr ""

msgid "Let the show begin!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Notes on availability"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An \"Availability: Unix\" note means that this function is commonly found on "
"Unix systems.  It does not make any claims about its existence on a specific "
"operating system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If not separately noted, all functions that claim \"Availability: Unix\" are "
"supported on macOS, which builds on a Unix core."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an availability note contains both a minimum Kernel version and a minimum "
"libc version, then both conditions must hold. For example a feature with "
"note *Availability: Linux >= 3.17 with glibc >= 2.27* requires both Linux "
"3.17 or newer and glibc 2.27 or newer."
msgstr ""

msgid "WebAssembly platforms"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `WebAssembly`_ platforms ``wasm32-emscripten`` (`Emscripten`_) and "
"``wasm32-wasi`` (`WASI`_) provide a subset of POSIX APIs. WebAssembly "
"runtimes and browsers are sandboxed and have limited access to the host and "
"external resources. Any Python standard library module that uses processes, "
"threading, networking, signals, or other forms of inter-process "
"communication (IPC), is either not available or may not work as on other "
"Unix-like systems. File I/O, file system, and Unix permission-related "
"functions are restricted, too. Emscripten does not permit blocking I/O. "
"Other blocking operations like :func:`~time.sleep` block the browser event "
"loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The properties and behavior of Python on WebAssembly platforms depend on the "
"`Emscripten`_-SDK or `WASI`_-SDK version, WASM runtimes (browser, NodeJS, "
"`wasmtime`_), and Python build time flags. WebAssembly, Emscripten, and WASI "
"are evolving standards; some features like networking may be supported in "
"the future."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For Python in the browser, users should consider `Pyodide`_ or `PyScript`_. "
"PyScript is built on top of Pyodide, which itself is built on top of CPython "
"and Emscripten. Pyodide provides access to browsers' JavaScript and DOM APIs "
"as well as limited networking capabilities with JavaScript's "
"``XMLHttpRequest`` and ``Fetch`` APIs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Process-related APIs are not available or always fail with an error. That "
"includes APIs that spawn new processes (:func:`~os.fork`, :func:`~os."
"execve`), wait for processes (:func:`~os.waitpid`), send signals (:func:`~os."
"kill`), or otherwise interact with processes. The :mod:`subprocess` is "
"importable but does not work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`socket` module is available, but is limited and behaves "
"differently from other platforms. On Emscripten, sockets are always non-"
"blocking and require additional JavaScript code and helpers on the server to "
"proxy TCP through WebSockets; see `Emscripten Networking`_ for more "
"information. WASI snapshot preview 1 only permits sockets from an existing "
"file descriptor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some functions are stubs that either don't do anything and always return "
"hardcoded values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Functions related to file descriptors, file permissions, file ownership, and "
"links are limited and don't support some operations. For example, WASI does "
"not permit symlinks with absolute file names."
msgstr ""
