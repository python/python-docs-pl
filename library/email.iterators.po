"Iterating over a message object tree is fairly easy with the :meth:`Message."
"walk <email.message.Message.walk>` method.  The :mod:`email.iterators` "
"module provides some useful higher level iterations over message object "
"trees."

msgid ""
"This iterates over all the payloads in all the subparts of *msg*, returning "
"the string payloads line-by-line.  It skips over all the subpart headers, "
"and it skips over any subpart with a payload that isn't a Python string.  "
"This is somewhat equivalent to reading the flat text representation of the "
"message from a file using :meth:`~io.TextIOBase.readline`, skipping over all "
"the intervening headers."

msgid ""
"Optional *decode* is passed through to :meth:`Message.get_payload <email."
"message.Message.get_payload>`."

msgid ""
"This iterates over all the subparts of *msg*, returning only those subparts "
"that match the MIME type specified by *maintype* and *subtype*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that *subtype* is optional; if omitted, then subpart MIME type matching "
"is done only with the main type.  *maintype* is optional too; it defaults "
"to :mimetype:`text`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Thus, by default :func:`typed_subpart_iterator` returns each subpart that "
"has a MIME type of :mimetype:`text/\\*`."

"The following function has been added as a useful debugging tool.  It should "
"*not* be considered part of the supported public interface for the package."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Prints an indented representation of the content types of the message object "
"structure.  For example:"

msgid ""
"Optional *fp* is a file-like object to print the output to.  It must be "
"suitable for Python's :func:`print` function.  *level* is used internally. "
"*include_default*, if true, prints the default type as well."
