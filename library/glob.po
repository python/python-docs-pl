msgid ":mod:`glob` --- Unix style pathname pattern expansion"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/glob.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`glob` module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern "
"according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned "
"in arbitrary order.  No tilde expansion is done, but ``*``, ``?``, and "
"character ranges expressed with ``[]`` will be correctly matched.  This is "
"done by using the :func:`os.scandir` and :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` functions "
"in concert, and not by actually invoking a subshell."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that files beginning with a dot (``.``) can only be matched by patterns "
"that also start with a dot, unlike :func:`fnmatch.fnmatch` or :func:`pathlib."
"Path.glob`. (For tilde and shell variable expansion, use :func:`os.path."
"expanduser` and :func:`os.path.expandvars`.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a literal match, wrap the meta-characters in brackets. For example, "
"``'[?]'`` matches the character ``'?'``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`pathlib` module offers high-level path objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a possibly empty list of path names that match *pathname*, which must "
"be a string containing a path specification. *pathname* can be either "
"absolute (like :file:`/usr/src/Python-1.5/Makefile`) or relative (like :file:"
"`../../Tools/\\*/\\*.gif`), and can contain shell-style wildcards. Broken "
"symlinks are included in the results (as in the shell). Whether or not the "
"results are sorted depends on the file system.  If a file that satisfies "
"conditions is removed or added during the call of this function, whether a "
"path name for that file will be included is unspecified."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *root_dir* is not ``None``, it should be a :term:`path-like object` "
"specifying the root directory for searching.  It has the same effect on :"
"func:`glob` as changing the current directory before calling it.  If "
"*pathname* is relative, the result will contain paths relative to *root_dir*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function can support :ref:`paths relative to directory descriptors "
"<dir_fd>` with the *dir_fd* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *recursive* is true, the pattern \"``**``\" will match any files and zero "
"or more directories, subdirectories and symbolic links to directories. If "
"the pattern is followed by an :data:`os.sep` or :data:`os.altsep` then files "
"will not match."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *include_hidden* is true, \"``**``\" pattern will match hidden "
"directories."

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``glob.glob`` with arguments "
"``pathname``, ``recursive``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``glob.glob/2`` with arguments "
"``pathname``, ``recursive``, ``root_dir``, ``dir_fd``."

msgid ""
"Using the \"``**``\" pattern in large directory trees may consume an "
"inordinate amount of time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Support for recursive globs using \"``**``\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *root_dir* and *dir_fd* parameters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *include_hidden* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return an :term:`iterator` which yields the same values as :func:`glob` "
"without actually storing them all simultaneously."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Escape all special characters (``'?'``, ``'*'`` and ``'['``). This is useful "
"if you want to match an arbitrary literal string that may have special "
"characters in it.  Special characters in drive/UNC sharepoints are not "
"escaped, e.g. on Windows ``escape('//?/c:/Quo vadis?.txt')`` returns ``'//?/"
"c:/Quo vadis[?].txt'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, consider a directory containing the following files: :file:`1."
"gif`, :file:`2.txt`, :file:`card.gif` and a subdirectory :file:`sub` which "
"contains only the file :file:`3.txt`.  :func:`glob` will produce the "
"following results.  Notice how any leading components of the path are "
"preserved. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the directory contains files starting with ``.`` they won't be matched by "
"default. For example, consider a directory containing :file:`card.gif` and :"
