"This module provides the :class:`ConfigParser` class which implements a "

msgid "Supported Datatypes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Config parsers do not guess datatypes of values in configuration files, "

"Since this task is so common, config parsers provide a range of handy getter "
"methods to handle integers, floats and booleans.  The last one is the most "
"interesting because simply passing the value to ``bool()`` would do no good "
"since ``bool('False')`` is still ``True``.  This is why config parsers also "
"provide :meth:`~ConfigParser.getboolean`.  This method is case-insensitive "
"and recognizes Boolean values from ``'yes'``/``'no'``, ``'on'``/``'off'``, "
"``'true'``/``'false'`` and ``'1'``/``'0'`` [1]_.  For example:"

"methods.  You can register your own converters and customize the provided "
"ones. [1]_"

">>> topsecret.get('Cipher')\n"
">>> topsecret.get('Cipher', '3des-cbc')\n"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please note that default values have precedence over fallback values. For "
"instance, in our example the ``'CompressionLevel'`` key was specified only "
"in the ``'DEFAULT'`` section.  If we try to get it from the section "
"``'topsecret.server.example'``, we will always get the default, even if we "
"specify a fallback:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> topsecret.get('CompressionLevel', '3')\n"
"'9'"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One more thing to be aware of is that the parser-level :meth:`~ConfigParser."
"get` method provides a custom, more complex interface, maintained for "
"backwards compatibility.  When using this method, a fallback value can be "
"provided via the ``fallback`` keyword-only argument:"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A configuration file consists of sections, each led by a ``[section]`` "
"header, followed by key/value entries separated by a specific string (``=`` "

"keys are not [1]_.  Leading and trailing whitespace is removed from keys and "
"values. Values can be omitted if the parser is configured to allow it [1]_, "
"in which case the key/value delimiter may also be left out.  Values can also "

"specific order in the configuration file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With ``interpolation`` set to ``None``, the parser would simply return "

"Interpolation can span multiple levels.  For convenience, if the ``section:"
"`` part is omitted, interpolation defaults to the current section (and "
"possibly the default values from the special section)."

msgid "Mapping Protocol Access"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mapping protocol access is a generic name for functionality that enables "
"using custom objects as if they were dictionaries.  In case of :mod:"
"`configparser`, the mapping interface implementation is using the "
"``parser['section']['option']`` notation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``parser['section']`` in particular returns a proxy for the section's data "
"in the parser.  This means that the values are not copied but they are taken "
"from the original parser on demand.  What's even more important is that when "
"values are changed on a section proxy, they are actually mutated in the "
"original parser."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":mod:`configparser` objects behave as close to actual dictionaries as "
"possible. The mapping interface is complete and adheres to the :class:"
"`~collections.abc.MutableMapping` ABC. However, there are a few differences "
"that should be taken into account:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, all keys in sections are accessible in a case-insensitive manner "
"[1]_.  E.g. ``for option in parser[\"section\"]`` yields only "
"``optionxform``'ed option key names.  This means lowercased keys by "
"default.  At the same time, for a section that holds the key ``'a'``, both "
"expressions return ``True``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"a\" in parser[\"section\"]\n"
"\"A\" in parser[\"section\"]"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All sections include ``DEFAULTSECT`` values as well which means that ``."
"clear()`` on a section may not leave the section visibly empty.  This is "
"because default values cannot be deleted from the section (because "
"technically they are not there).  If they are overridden in the section, "
"deleting causes the default value to be visible again.  Trying to delete a "
"default value causes a :exc:`KeyError`."
msgstr ""

msgid "``DEFAULTSECT`` cannot be removed from the parser:"
msgstr ""

msgid "trying to delete it raises :exc:`ValueError`,"
msgstr ""

msgid "``parser.clear()`` leaves it intact,"
msgstr ""

msgid "``parser.popitem()`` never returns it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``parser.get(section, option, **kwargs)`` - the second argument is **not** a "
"fallback value.  Note however that the section-level ``get()`` methods are "
"compatible both with the mapping protocol and the classic configparser API."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``parser.items()`` is compatible with the mapping protocol (returns a list "
"of *section_name*, *section_proxy* pairs including the DEFAULTSECT).  "
"However, this method can also be invoked with arguments: ``parser."
"items(section, raw, vars)``.  The latter call returns a list of *option*, "
"*value* pairs for a specified ``section``, with all interpolations expanded "
"(unless ``raw=True`` is provided)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The mapping protocol is implemented on top of the existing legacy API so "
"that subclasses overriding the original interface still should have mappings "
"working as expected."
msgstr ""

msgid "Customizing Parser Behaviour"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are nearly as many INI format variants as there are applications using "
"it. :mod:`configparser` goes a long way to provide support for the largest "
"sensible set of INI styles available.  The default functionality is mainly "
"dictated by historical background and it's very likely that you will want to "
"customize some of the features."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The most common way to change the way a specific config parser works is to "
"use the :meth:`!__init__` options:"
msgstr ""

msgid "*defaults*, default value: ``None``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This option accepts a dictionary of key-value pairs which will be initially "
"put in the ``DEFAULT`` section.  This makes for an elegant way to support "
"concise configuration files that don't specify values which are the same as "
"the documented default."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Hint: if you want to specify default values for a specific section, use :"
"meth:`~ConfigParser.read_dict` before you read the actual file."
msgstr ""

msgid "*dict_type*, default value: :class:`dict`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This option has a major impact on how the mapping protocol will behave and "
"how the written configuration files look.  With the standard dictionary, "
"every section is stored in the order they were added to the parser.  Same "
"goes for options within sections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An alternative dictionary type can be used for example to sort sections and "
"options on write-back."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Please note: there are ways to add a set of key-value pairs in a single "
"operation.  When you use a regular dictionary in those operations, the order "
