msgid ":mod:`zoneinfo` --- IANA time zone support"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/zoneinfo`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`zoneinfo` module provides a concrete time zone implementation to "
"support the IANA time zone database as originally specified in :pep:`615`. "
"By default, :mod:`zoneinfo` uses the system's time zone data if available; "
"if no system time zone data is available, the library will fall back to "
"using the first-party `tzdata`_ package available on PyPI."
msgstr ""

msgid "Module: :mod:`datetime`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Provides the :class:`~datetime.time` and :class:`~datetime.datetime` types "
"with which the :class:`ZoneInfo` class is designed to be used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Package `tzdata`_"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First-party package maintained by the CPython core developers to supply time "
"zone data via PyPI."
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`Availability <availability>`: not Emscripten, not WASI."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly platforms "
"``wasm32-emscripten`` and ``wasm32-wasi``. See :ref:`wasm-availability` for "
"more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using ``ZoneInfo``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`ZoneInfo` is a concrete implementation of the :class:`datetime."
"tzinfo` abstract base class, and is intended to be attached to ``tzinfo``, "
"either via the constructor, the :meth:`datetime.replace <datetime.datetime."
"replace>` method or :meth:`datetime.astimezone <datetime.datetime."
"astimezone>`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Datetimes constructed in this way are compatible with datetime arithmetic "
"and handle daylight saving time transitions with no further intervention::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These time zones also support the :attr:`~datetime.datetime.fold` attribute "
"introduced in :pep:`495`.  During offset transitions which induce ambiguous "
"times (such as a daylight saving time to standard time transition), the "
"offset from *before* the transition is used when ``fold=0``, and the offset "
"*after* the transition is used when ``fold=1``, for example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When converting from another time zone, the fold will be set to the correct "
"value::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Data sources"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``zoneinfo`` module does not directly provide time zone data, and "
"instead pulls time zone information from the system time zone database or "
"the first-party PyPI package `tzdata`_, if available. Some systems, "
"including notably Windows systems, do not have an IANA database available, "
"and so for projects targeting cross-platform compatibility that require time "
"zone data, it is recommended to declare a dependency on tzdata. If neither "
"system data nor tzdata are available, all calls to :class:`ZoneInfo` will "
"raise :exc:`ZoneInfoNotFoundError`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuring the data sources"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When ``ZoneInfo(key)`` is called, the constructor first searches the "
"directories specified in :data:`TZPATH` for a file matching ``key``, and on "
"failure looks for a match in the tzdata package. This behavior can be "
"configured in three ways:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default :data:`TZPATH` when not otherwise specified can be configured "
"at :ref:`compile time <zoneinfo_data_compile_time_config>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":data:`TZPATH` can be configured using :ref:`an environment variable "
"<zoneinfo_data_environment_var>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At :ref:`runtime <zoneinfo_data_runtime_config>`, the search path can be "
"manipulated using the :func:`reset_tzpath` function."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compile-time configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default :data:`TZPATH` includes several common deployment locations for "
"the time zone database (except on Windows, where there are no \"well-known\" "
"locations for time zone data). On POSIX systems, downstream distributors and "
"those building Python from source who know where their system time zone data "
"is deployed may change the default time zone path by specifying the compile-"
"time option ``TZPATH`` (or, more likely, the :option:`configure flag --with-"
"tzpath <--with-tzpath>`), which should be a string delimited by :data:`os."
"pathsep`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On all platforms, the configured value is available as the ``TZPATH`` key "
"in :func:`sysconfig.get_config_var`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Environment configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When initializing :data:`TZPATH` (either at import time or whenever :func:"
"`reset_tzpath` is called with no arguments), the ``zoneinfo`` module will "
"use the environment variable ``PYTHONTZPATH``, if it exists, to set the "
"search path."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is an :data:`os.pathsep`-separated string containing the time zone "
"search path to use. It must consist of only absolute rather than relative "
"paths. Relative components specified in ``PYTHONTZPATH`` will not be used, "
"but otherwise the behavior when a relative path is specified is "
"implementation-defined; CPython will raise :exc:`InvalidTZPathWarning`, but "
"other implementations are free to silently ignore the erroneous component or "
"raise an exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To set the system to ignore the system data and use the tzdata package "
"instead, set ``PYTHONTZPATH=\"\"``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Runtime configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The TZ search path can also be configured at runtime using the :func:"
"`reset_tzpath` function. This is generally not an advisable operation, "
"though it is reasonable to use it in test functions that require the use of "
"a specific time zone path (or require disabling access to the system time "
"zones)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``ZoneInfo`` class"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A concrete :class:`datetime.tzinfo` subclass that represents an IANA time "
"zone specified by the string ``key``. Calls to the primary constructor will "
"always return objects that compare identically; put another way, barring "
"cache invalidation via :meth:`ZoneInfo.clear_cache`, for all values of "
"``key``, the following assertion will always be true:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``key`` must be in the form of a relative, normalized POSIX path, with no up-"
"level references. The constructor will raise :exc:`ValueError` if a non-"
"conforming key is passed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If no file matching ``key`` is found, the constructor will raise :exc:"
"`ZoneInfoNotFoundError`."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``ZoneInfo`` class has two alternate constructors:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Constructs a ``ZoneInfo`` object from a file-like object returning bytes (e."
"g. a file opened in binary mode or an :class:`io.BytesIO` object). Unlike "
"the primary constructor, this always constructs a new object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``key`` parameter sets the name of the zone for the purposes of :py:meth:"
"`~object.__str__` and :py:meth:`~object.__repr__`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Objects created via this constructor cannot be pickled (see `pickling`_)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An alternate constructor that bypasses the constructor's cache. It is "
"identical to the primary constructor, but returns a new object on each call. "
"This is most likely to be useful for testing or demonstration purposes, but "
"it can also be used to create a system with a different cache invalidation "
"strategy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Objects created via this constructor will also bypass the cache of a "
"deserializing process when unpickled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using this constructor may change the semantics of your datetimes in "
"surprising ways, only use it if you know that you need to."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following class methods are also available:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A method for invalidating the cache on the ``ZoneInfo`` class. If no "
"arguments are passed, all caches are invalidated and the next call to the "
"primary constructor for each key will return a new instance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an iterable of key names is passed to the ``only_keys`` parameter, only "
"the specified keys will be removed from the cache. Keys passed to "
"``only_keys`` but not found in the cache are ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Invoking this function may change the semantics of datetimes using "
"``ZoneInfo`` in surprising ways; this modifies process-wide global state and "
"thus may have wide-ranging effects. Only use it if you know that you need to."
msgstr ""

msgid "The class has one attribute:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a read-only :term:`attribute` that returns the value of ``key`` "
"passed to the constructor, which should be a lookup key in the IANA time "
"zone database (e.g. ``America/New_York``, ``Europe/Paris`` or ``Asia/"
"Tokyo``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For zones constructed from file without specifying a ``key`` parameter, this "
"will be set to ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although it is a somewhat common practice to expose these to end users, "
"these values are designed to be primary keys for representing the relevant "
"zones and not necessarily user-facing elements.  Projects like CLDR (the "
"Unicode Common Locale Data Repository) can be used to get more user-friendly "
"strings from these keys."
msgstr ""

msgid "String representations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The string representation returned when calling :py:class:`str` on a :class:"
"`ZoneInfo` object defaults to using the :attr:`ZoneInfo.key` attribute (see "
"the note on usage in the attribute documentation)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For objects constructed from a file without specifying a ``key`` parameter, "
"``str`` falls back to calling :func:`repr`. ``ZoneInfo``'s ``repr`` is "
"implementation-defined and not necessarily stable between versions, but it "
"is guaranteed not to be a valid ``ZoneInfo`` key."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pickle serialization"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Rather than serializing all transition data, ``ZoneInfo`` objects are "
"serialized by key, and ``ZoneInfo`` objects constructed from files (even "
"those with a value for ``key`` specified) cannot be pickled."
msgstr ""

msgid "The behavior of a ``ZoneInfo`` file depends on how it was constructed:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``ZoneInfo(key)``: When constructed with the primary constructor, a "
"``ZoneInfo`` object is serialized by key, and when deserialized, the "
"deserializing process uses the primary and thus it is expected that these "
"are expected to be the same object as other references to the same time "
"zone.  For example, if ``europe_berlin_pkl`` is a string containing a pickle "
"constructed from ``ZoneInfo(\"Europe/Berlin\")``, one would expect the "
"following behavior:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``ZoneInfo.no_cache(key)``: When constructed from the cache-bypassing "
"constructor, the ``ZoneInfo`` object is also serialized by key, but when "
"deserialized, the deserializing process uses the cache bypassing "
"constructor. If ``europe_berlin_pkl_nc`` is a string containing a pickle "
"constructed from ``ZoneInfo.no_cache(\"Europe/Berlin\")``, one would expect "
"the following behavior:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``ZoneInfo.from_file(fobj, /, key=None)``: When constructed from a file, the "
"``ZoneInfo`` object raises an exception on pickling. If an end user wants to "
"pickle a ``ZoneInfo`` constructed from a file, it is recommended that they "
"use a wrapper type or a custom serialization function: either serializing by "
"key or storing the contents of the file object and serializing that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method of serialization requires that the time zone data for the "
"required key be available on both the serializing and deserializing side, "
"similar to the way that references to classes and functions are expected to "
"exist in both the serializing and deserializing environments. It also means "
"that no guarantees are made about the consistency of results when unpickling "
"a ``ZoneInfo`` pickled in an environment with a different version of the "
"time zone data."
msgstr ""

msgid "Functions"
msgstr "Zadania"

msgid ""
"Get a set containing all the valid keys for IANA time zones available "
"anywhere on the time zone path. This is recalculated on every call to the "
"function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function only includes canonical zone names and does not include "
"\"special\" zones such as those under the ``posix/`` and ``right/`` "
"directories, or the ``posixrules`` zone."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function may open a large number of files, as the best way to determine "
"if a file on the time zone path is a valid time zone is to read the \"magic "
"string\" at the beginning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These values are not designed to be exposed to end-users; for user facing "
"elements, applications should use something like CLDR (the Unicode Common "
"Locale Data Repository) to get more user-friendly strings. See also the "
"cautionary note on :attr:`ZoneInfo.key`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sets or resets the time zone search path (:data:`TZPATH`) for the module. "
"When called with no arguments, :data:`TZPATH` is set to the default value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Calling ``reset_tzpath`` will not invalidate the :class:`ZoneInfo` cache, "
"and so calls to the primary ``ZoneInfo`` constructor will only use the new "
"``TZPATH`` in the case of a cache miss."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``to`` parameter must be a :term:`sequence` of strings or :class:`os."
"PathLike` and not a string, all of which must be absolute paths. :exc:"
"`ValueError` will be raised if something other than an absolute path is "
"passed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A read-only sequence representing the time zone search path -- when "
"constructing a ``ZoneInfo`` from a key, the key is joined to each entry in "
"the ``TZPATH``, and the first file found is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``TZPATH`` may contain only absolute paths, never relative paths, regardless "
"of how it is configured."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The object that ``zoneinfo.TZPATH`` points to may change in response to a "
"call to :func:`reset_tzpath`, so it is recommended to use ``zoneinfo."
"TZPATH`` rather than importing ``TZPATH`` from ``zoneinfo`` or assigning a "
