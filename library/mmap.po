msgid ":mod:`mmap` --- Memory-mapped file support"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`Availability <availability>`: not Emscripten, not WASI."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly platforms "
"``wasm32-emscripten`` and ``wasm32-wasi``. See :ref:`wasm-availability` for "
"more information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Memory-mapped file objects behave like both :class:`bytearray` and like :"
"term:`file objects <file object>`.  You can use mmap objects in most places "
"where :class:`bytearray` are expected; for example, you can use the :mod:"
"`re` module to search through a memory-mapped file.  You can also change a "
"single byte by doing ``obj[index] = 97``, or change a subsequence by "
"assigning to a slice: ``obj[i1:i2] = b'...'``.  You can also read and write "
"data starting at the current file position, and :meth:`seek` through the "
"file to different positions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A memory-mapped file is created by the :class:`~mmap.mmap` constructor, "
"which is different on Unix and on Windows.  In either case you must provide "
"a file descriptor for a file opened for update. If you wish to map an "
"existing Python file object, use its :meth:`fileno` method to obtain the "
"correct value for the *fileno* parameter.  Otherwise, you can open the file "
"using the :func:`os.open` function, which returns a file descriptor directly "
"(the file still needs to be closed when done)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to create a memory-mapping for a writable, buffered file, you "
"should :func:`~io.IOBase.flush` the file first.  This is necessary to ensure "
"that local modifications to the buffers are actually available to the "
"mapping."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For both the Unix and Windows versions of the constructor, *access* may be "
"specified as an optional keyword parameter. *access* accepts one of four "
"values: :const:`ACCESS_READ`, :const:`ACCESS_WRITE`, or :const:`ACCESS_COPY` "
"to specify read-only, write-through or copy-on-write memory respectively, "
"or :const:`ACCESS_DEFAULT` to defer to *prot*.  *access* can be used on both "
"Unix and Windows.  If *access* is not specified, Windows mmap returns a "
"write-through mapping.  The initial memory values for all three access types "
"are taken from the specified file.  Assignment to an :const:`ACCESS_READ` "
"memory map raises a :exc:`TypeError` exception.  Assignment to an :const:"
"`ACCESS_WRITE` memory map affects both memory and the underlying file. "
"Assignment to an :const:`ACCESS_COPY` memory map affects memory but does not "
"update the underlying file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added :const:`ACCESS_DEFAULT` constant."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To map anonymous memory, -1 should be passed as the fileno along with the "
"length."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**(Windows version)** Maps *length* bytes from the file specified by the "
"file handle *fileno*, and creates a mmap object.  If *length* is larger than "
"the current size of the file, the file is extended to contain *length* "
"bytes.  If *length* is ``0``, the maximum length of the map is the current "
"size of the file, except that if the file is empty Windows raises an "
"exception (you cannot create an empty mapping on Windows)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*tagname*, if specified and not ``None``, is a string giving a tag name for "
"the mapping.  Windows allows you to have many different mappings against the "
"same file.  If you specify the name of an existing tag, that tag is opened, "
"otherwise a new tag of this name is created.  If this parameter is omitted "
"or ``None``, the mapping is created without a name.  Avoiding the use of the "
"tag parameter will assist in keeping your code portable between Unix and "
"Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*offset* may be specified as a non-negative integer offset. mmap references "
"will be relative to the offset from the beginning of the file. *offset* "
"defaults to 0.  *offset* must be a multiple of the :const:"
"`ALLOCATIONGRANULARITY`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``mmap.__new__`` with arguments "
"``fileno``, ``length``, ``access``, ``offset``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**(Unix version)** Maps *length* bytes from the file specified by the file "
"descriptor *fileno*, and returns a mmap object.  If *length* is ``0``, the "
"maximum length of the map will be the current size of the file when :class:"
"`~mmap.mmap` is called."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*flags* specifies the nature of the mapping. :const:`MAP_PRIVATE` creates a "
"private copy-on-write mapping, so changes to the contents of the mmap object "
"will be private to this process, and :const:`MAP_SHARED` creates a mapping "
"that's shared with all other processes mapping the same areas of the file.  "
"The default value is :const:`MAP_SHARED`. Some systems have additional "
"possible flags with the full list specified in :ref:`MAP_* constants <map-"
"constants>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*prot*, if specified, gives the desired memory protection; the two most "
"useful values are :const:`PROT_READ` and :const:`PROT_WRITE`, to specify "
"that the pages may be read or written.  *prot* defaults to :const:`PROT_READ "
"\\| PROT_WRITE`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*access* may be specified in lieu of *flags* and *prot* as an optional "
"keyword parameter.  It is an error to specify both *flags*, *prot* and "
"*access*.  See the description of *access* above for information on how to "
"use this parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*offset* may be specified as a non-negative integer offset. mmap references "
"will be relative to the offset from the beginning of the file. *offset* "
"defaults to 0. *offset* must be a multiple of :const:`ALLOCATIONGRANULARITY` "
"which is equal to :const:`PAGESIZE` on Unix systems."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To ensure validity of the created memory mapping the file specified by the "
"descriptor *fileno* is internally automatically synchronized with the "
"physical backing store on macOS."
msgstr ""

msgid "This example shows a simple way of using :class:`~mmap.mmap`::"
