msgid ""
"The :mod:`curses` module provides an interface to the curses library, the de-"
"facto standard for portable advanced terminal handling."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While curses is most widely used in the Unix environment, versions are "
"available for Windows, DOS, and possibly other systems as well.  This "
"extension module is designed to match the API of ncurses, an open-source "
"curses library hosted on Linux and the BSD variants of Unix."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whenever the documentation mentions a *character* it can be specified as an "
"integer, a one-character Unicode string or a one-byte byte string."

msgid "The module :mod:`curses` defines the following exception:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Exception raised when a curses library function returns an error."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whenever *x* or *y* arguments to a function or a method are optional, they "
"default to the current cursor location. Whenever *attr* is optional, it "
"defaults to :const:`A_NORMAL`."
msgstr ""

msgid "The module :mod:`curses` defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the output speed of the terminal in bits per second.  On software "
"terminal emulators it will have a fixed high value. Included for historical "
"reasons; in former times, it was used to  write output loops for time delays "
"and occasionally to change interfaces depending on the line speed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Emit a short attention sound."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` or ``False``, depending on whether the programmer can change "
"the colors displayed by the terminal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enter cbreak mode.  In cbreak mode (sometimes called \"rare\" mode) normal "
"tty line buffering is turned off and characters are available to be read one "
"by one. However, unlike raw mode, special characters (interrupt, quit, "
"suspend, and flow control) retain their effects on the tty driver and "
"calling program.  Calling first :func:`raw` then :func:`cbreak` leaves the "
"terminal in cbreak mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the intensity of the red, green, and blue (RGB) components in the "
"color *color_number*, which must be between ``0`` and ``COLORS - 1``.  "
"Return a 3-tuple, containing the R,G,B values for the given color, which "
"will be between ``0`` (no component) and ``1000`` (maximum amount of "
"component)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the attribute value for displaying text in the specified color pair. "
"Only the first 256 color pairs are supported. This attribute value can be "
"combined with :const:`A_STANDOUT`, :const:`A_REVERSE`, and the other :const:"
"`!A_\\*` attributes.  :func:`pair_number` is the counterpart to this "
"function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the cursor state.  *visibility* can be set to ``0``, ``1``, or ``2``, "
"for invisible, normal, or very visible.  If the terminal supports the "
"visibility requested, return the previous cursor state; otherwise raise an "
"exception.  On many terminals, the \"visible\" mode is an underline cursor "
"and the \"very visible\" mode is a block cursor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Save the current terminal mode as the \"program\" mode, the mode when the "
"running program is using curses.  (Its counterpart is the \"shell\" mode, "
"for when the program is not in curses.)  Subsequent calls to :func:"
"`reset_prog_mode` will restore this mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Save the current terminal mode as the \"shell\" mode, the mode when the "

msgstr ""

msgid "Insert an *ms* millisecond pause in output."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Update the physical screen.  The curses library keeps two data structures, "
"one representing the current physical screen contents and a virtual screen "
"representing the desired next state.  The :func:`doupdate` ground updates "
"the physical screen to match the virtual screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The virtual screen may be updated by a :meth:`~window.noutrefresh` call "
"after write operations such as :meth:`~window.addstr` have been performed on "
"a window.  The normal :meth:`~window.refresh` call is simply :meth:`!"
"noutrefresh` followed by :func:`!doupdate`; if you have to update multiple "
"windows, you can speed performance and perhaps reduce screen flicker by "
"issuing :meth:`!noutrefresh` calls on all windows, followed by a single :"
"func:`!doupdate`."

"Enter echo mode.  In echo mode, each character input is echoed to the screen "
"as it is entered."
msgstr ""

msgid "De-initialize the library, and return terminal to normal status."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the user's current erase character as a one-byte bytes object.  Under "
"Unix operating systems this is a property of the controlling tty of the "
"curses program, and is not set by the curses library itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`.filter` routine, if used, must be called before :func:`initscr` "
"is called.  The effect is that, during those calls, :envvar:`LINES` is set "
"to ``1``; the capabilities ``clear``, ``cup``, ``cud``, ``cud1``, ``cuu1``, "
"``cuu``, ``vpa`` are disabled; and the ``home`` string is set to the value "
"of ``cr``. The effect is that the cursor is confined to the current line, "
"and so are screen updates.  This may be used for enabling character-at-a-"
"time  line editing without touching the rest of the screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Flash the screen.  That is, change it to reverse-video and then change it "

"After :meth:`~window.getch` returns :const:`KEY_MOUSE` to signal a mouse "
"event, this method should be called to retrieve the queued mouse event, "
"represented as a 5-tuple ``(id, x, y, z, bstate)``. *id* is an ID value used "
"to distinguish multiple devices, and *x*, *y*, *z* are the event's "

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if the terminal can display colors; otherwise, return "
"``False``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if the module supports extended colors; otherwise, return "

msgstr ""

msgid "Extended color support requires ncurses version 6.1 or later."

"modern software terminal emulators have such capabilities."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if the terminal has insert- and delete-line capabilities, or "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Take a key value *ch*, and return ``True`` if the current terminal type "
"recognizes a key with that value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Used for half-delay mode, which is similar to cbreak mode in that characters "
"typed by the user are immediately available to the program. However, after "
"blocking for *tenths* tenths of seconds, raise an exception if nothing has "
"been typed.  The value of *tenths* must be a number between ``1`` and "
"``255``.  Use :func:`nocbreak` to leave half-delay mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Change the definition of a color, taking the number of the color to be "

"``True``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Change the definition of a color-pair.  It takes three arguments: the number "

"handles elementary text editing in a curses window, supporting a set of "
"keybindings resembling those of Emacs (thus, also of Netscape Navigator, "
