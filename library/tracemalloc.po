"The tracemalloc module is a debug tool to trace memory blocks allocated by "
"Python. It provides the following information:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Traceback where an object was allocated"

msgid ""
"Statistics on allocated memory blocks per filename and per line number: "
"total size, number and average size of allocated memory blocks"
msgstr ""

msgid "Compute the differences between two snapshots to detect memory leaks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To trace most memory blocks allocated by Python, the module should be "
"started as early as possible by setting the :envvar:`PYTHONTRACEMALLOC` "
"environment variable to ``1``, or by using :option:`-X` ``tracemalloc`` "
"command line option. The :func:`tracemalloc.start` function can be called at "
"runtime to start tracing Python memory allocations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, a trace of an allocated memory block only stores the most recent "
"frame (1 frame). To store 25 frames at startup: set the :envvar:"
"`PYTHONTRACEMALLOC` environment variable to ``25``, or use the :option:`-X` "
"``tracemalloc=25`` command line option."

"Example of output before/after running some tests of the Python test suite::"

"We can see that Python has loaded ``8173 KiB`` of module data (bytecode and "

msgid ""
"Using :func:`reset_peak` ensured we could accurately record the peak during "
"the computation of ``small_sum``, even though it is much smaller than the "
"overall peak size of memory blocks since the :func:`start` call. Without the "
"call to :func:`reset_peak`, ``second_peak`` would still be the peak from the "
"computation ``large_sum`` (that is, equal to ``first_peak``). In this case, "
"both peaks are much higher than the final memory usage, and which suggests "
"we could optimise (by removing the unnecessary call to :class:`list`, and "
"writing ``sum(range(...))``)."
