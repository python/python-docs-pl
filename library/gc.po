msgid ":mod:`gc` --- Garbage Collector interface"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides an interface to the optional garbage collector.  It "
"provides the ability to disable the collector, tune the collection "
"frequency, and set debugging options.  It also provides access to "
"unreachable objects that the collector found but cannot free.  Since the "
"collector supplements the reference counting already used in Python, you can "
"disable the collector if you are sure your program does not create reference "
"cycles.  Automatic collection can be disabled by calling ``gc.disable()``.  "
"To debug a leaking program call ``gc.set_debug(gc.DEBUG_LEAK)``. Notice that "
"this includes ``gc.DEBUG_SAVEALL``, causing garbage-collected objects to be "
"saved in gc.garbage for inspection."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`gc` module provides the following functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enable automatic garbage collection."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disable automatic garbage collection."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return ``True`` if automatic collection is enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With no arguments, run a full collection.  The optional argument "
"*generation* may be an integer specifying which generation to collect (from "
"0 to 2).  A :exc:`ValueError` is raised if the generation number  is "
"invalid. The number of unreachable objects found is returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The free lists maintained for a number of built-in types are cleared "
"whenever a full collection or collection of the highest generation (2) is "
"run.  Not all items in some free lists may be freed due to the particular "
"implementation, in particular :class:`float`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the garbage collection debugging flags. Debugging information will be "
"written to ``sys.stderr``.  See below for a list of debugging flags which "
"can be combined using bit operations to control debugging."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the debugging flags currently set."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a list of all objects tracked by the collector, excluding the list "
"returned. If *generation* is not None, return only the objects tracked by "
"the collector that are in that generation."
msgstr ""

msgid "New *generation* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``gc.get_objects`` with argument "
"``generation``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a list of three per-generation dictionaries containing collection "
"statistics since interpreter start.  The number of keys may change in the "
"future, but currently each dictionary will contain the following items:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``collections`` is the number of times this generation was collected;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``collected`` is the total number of objects collected inside this "
"generation;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``uncollectable`` is the total number of objects which were found to be "
"uncollectable (and were therefore moved to the :data:`garbage` list) inside "
"this generation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the garbage collection thresholds (the collection frequency). Setting "
"*threshold0* to zero disables collection."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The GC classifies objects into three generations depending on how many "
"collection sweeps they have survived.  New objects are placed in the "
"youngest generation (generation ``0``).  If an object survives a collection "
"it is moved into the next older generation.  Since generation ``2`` is the "
"oldest generation, objects in that generation remain there after a "
"collection.  In order to decide when to run, the collector keeps track of "
"the number object allocations and deallocations since the last collection.  "
"When the number of allocations minus the number of deallocations exceeds "
"*threshold0*, collection starts.  Initially only generation ``0`` is "
"examined.  If generation ``0`` has been examined more than *threshold1* "
"times since generation ``1`` has been examined, then generation ``1`` is "
"examined as well. With the third generation, things are a bit more "
"complicated, see `Collecting the oldest generation <https://devguide.python."
"org/garbage_collector/#collecting-the-oldest-generation>`_ for more "
"information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the current collection  counts as a tuple of ``(count0, count1, "
"count2)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the current collection thresholds as a tuple of ``(threshold0, "
"threshold1, threshold2)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the list of objects that directly refer to any of objs. This function "
"will only locate those containers which support garbage collection; "
"extension types which do refer to other objects but do not support garbage "
"collection will not be found."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that objects which have already been dereferenced, but which live in "
"cycles and have not yet been collected by the garbage collector can be "
"listed among the resulting referrers.  To get only currently live objects, "
"call :func:`collect` before calling :func:`get_referrers`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Care must be taken when using objects returned by :func:`get_referrers` "
"because some of them could still be under construction and hence in a "
"temporarily invalid state. Avoid using :func:`get_referrers` for any purpose "
"other than debugging."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``gc.get_referrers`` with "
"argument ``objs``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a list of objects directly referred to by any of the arguments. The "
"referents returned are those objects visited by the arguments' C-level :c:"
"member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_traverse` methods (if any), and may not be all "
"objects actually directly reachable.  :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_traverse` "
"methods are supported only by objects that support garbage collection, and "
"are only required to visit objects that may be involved in a cycle.  So, for "
"example, if an integer is directly reachable from an argument, that integer "
"object may or may not appear in the result list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``gc.get_referents`` with "
"argument ``objs``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns ``True`` if the object is currently tracked by the garbage "
"collector, ``False`` otherwise.  As a general rule, instances of atomic "
"types aren't tracked and instances of non-atomic types (containers, user-"
"defined objects...) are.  However, some type-specific optimizations can be "
"present in order to suppress the garbage collector footprint of simple "
"instances (e.g. dicts containing only atomic keys and values)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns ``True`` if the given object has been finalized by the garbage "
"collector, ``False`` otherwise. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Freeze all the objects tracked by the garbage collector; move them to a "
"permanent generation and ignore them in all the future collections."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a process will ``fork()`` without ``exec()``, avoiding unnecessary copy-"
"on-write in child processes will maximize memory sharing and reduce overall "
"memory usage. This requires both avoiding creation of freed \"holes\" in "
"memory pages in the parent process and ensuring that GC collections in child "
"processes won't touch the ``gc_refs`` counter of long-lived objects "
"originating in the parent process. To accomplish both, call ``gc.disable()`` "
"early in the parent process, ``gc.freeze()`` right before ``fork()``, and "
"``gc.enable()`` early in child processes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unfreeze the objects in the permanent generation, put them back into the "
"oldest generation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the number of objects in the permanent generation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following variables are provided for read-only access (you can mutate "
"the values but should not rebind them):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A list of objects which the collector found to be unreachable but could not "
"be freed (uncollectable objects).  Starting with Python 3.4, this list "
"should be empty most of the time, except when using instances of C extension "
"types with a non-``NULL`` ``tp_del`` slot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If :const:`DEBUG_SAVEALL` is set, then all unreachable objects will be added "
"to this list rather than freed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this list is non-empty at :term:`interpreter shutdown`, a :exc:"
"`ResourceWarning` is emitted, which is silent by default.  If :const:"
"`DEBUG_UNCOLLECTABLE` is set, in addition all uncollectable objects are "

msgid ""
"A list of callbacks that will be invoked by the garbage collector before and "
"after collection.  The callbacks will be called with two arguments, *phase* "
"and *info*."
msgstr ""

msgid "*phase* can be one of two values:"
msgstr ""

msgid "\"start\": The garbage collection is about to start."
msgstr ""

msgid "\"stop\": The garbage collection has finished."

"tuning the collection frequency."
msgstr ""

msgid "Print information on collectable objects found."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Print information of uncollectable objects found (objects which are not "

"shutdown`, if it isn't empty."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When set, all unreachable objects found will be appended to *garbage* rather "
