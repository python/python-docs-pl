msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/pathlib.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module offers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics "
"appropriate for different operating systems.  Path classes are divided "
"between :ref:`pure paths <pure-paths>`, which provide purely computational "
"operations without I/O, and :ref:`concrete paths <concrete-paths>`, which "
"inherit from pure paths but also provide I/O operations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you've never used this module before or just aren't sure which class is "
"right for your task, :class:`Path` is most likely what you need. It "
"instantiates a :ref:`concrete path <concrete-paths>` for the platform the "
"code is running on."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pure paths are useful in some special cases; for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to manipulate Windows paths on a Unix machine (or vice versa). "
"You cannot instantiate a :class:`WindowsPath` when running on Unix, but you "
"can instantiate :class:`PureWindowsPath`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You want to make sure that your code only manipulates paths without actually "
"accessing the OS. In this case, instantiating one of the pure classes may be "
"useful since those simply don't have any OS-accessing operations."
msgstr ""

msgid ":pep:`428`: The pathlib module -- object-oriented filesystem paths."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For low-level path manipulation on strings, you can also use the :mod:`os."
"path` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "Basic use"
msgstr ""

msgid "Importing the main class::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Listing subdirectories::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Listing Python source files in this directory tree::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Navigating inside a directory tree::"

msgid "Querying path properties::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Opening a file::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pure paths"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pure path objects provide path-handling operations which don't actually "
"access a filesystem.  There are three ways to access these classes, which we "
"also call *flavours*:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A generic class that represents the system's path flavour (instantiating it "
"creates either a :class:`PurePosixPath` or a :class:`PureWindowsPath`)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each element of *pathsegments* can be either a string representing a path "
"segment, an object implementing the :class:`os.PathLike` interface which "
"returns a string, or another path object::"
msgstr ""

msgid "When *pathsegments* is empty, the current directory is assumed::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a segment is an absolute path, all previous segments are ignored (like :"
"func:`os.path.join`)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, the drive is not reset when a rooted relative path segment (e."
"g., ``r'\\foo'``) is encountered::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Spurious slashes and single dots are collapsed, but double dots (``'..'``) "
"and leading double slashes (``'//'``) are not, since this would change the "
"meaning of a path for various reasons (e.g. symbolic links, UNC paths)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"(a naïve approach would make ``PurePosixPath('foo/../bar')`` equivalent to "
"``PurePosixPath('bar')``, which is wrong if ``foo`` is a symbolic link to "
"another directory)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pure path objects implement the :class:`os.PathLike` interface, allowing "
"them to be used anywhere the interface is accepted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support for the :class:`os.PathLike` interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A subclass of :class:`PurePath`, this path flavour represents non-Windows "
"filesystem paths::"
msgstr ""

msgid "*pathsegments* is specified similarly to :class:`PurePath`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A subclass of :class:`PurePath`, this path flavour represents Windows "
"filesystem paths, including `UNC paths`_::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regardless of the system you're running on, you can instantiate all of these "
"classes, since they don't provide any operation that does system calls."
msgstr ""

msgid "General properties"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Paths are immutable and :term:`hashable`.  Paths of a same flavour are "
"comparable and orderable.  These properties respect the flavour's case-"
"folding semantics::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Paths of a different flavour compare unequal and cannot be ordered::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Operators"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The slash operator helps create child paths, like :func:`os.path.join`. If "
"the argument is an absolute path, the previous path is ignored. On Windows, "
"the drive is not reset when the argument is a rooted relative path (e.g., "
"``r'\\foo'``)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A path object can be used anywhere an object implementing :class:`os."
"PathLike` is accepted::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The string representation of a path is the raw filesystem path itself (in "
"native form, e.g. with backslashes under Windows), which you can pass to any "
"function taking a file path as a string::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly, calling :class:`bytes` on a path gives the raw filesystem path as "
"a bytes object, as encoded by :func:`os.fsencode`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Calling :class:`bytes` is only recommended under Unix.  Under Windows, the "
"unicode form is the canonical representation of filesystem paths."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing individual parts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To access the individual \"parts\" (components) of a path, use the following "
"property:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A tuple giving access to the path's various components::"
msgstr ""

msgid "(note how the drive and local root are regrouped in a single part)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Methods and properties"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pure paths provide the following methods and properties:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A string representing the drive letter or name, if any::"
msgstr ""

msgid "UNC shares are also considered drives::"
msgstr ""

msgid "A string representing the (local or global) root, if any::"
msgstr ""

msgid "UNC shares always have a root::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the path starts with more than two successive slashes, :class:`~pathlib."
"PurePosixPath` collapses them::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This behavior conforms to *The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6*, "
"paragraph `4.11 Pathname Resolution <https://pubs.opengroup.org/"
"onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap04.html#tag_04_11>`_:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*\"A pathname that begins with two successive slashes may be interpreted in "
"an implementation-defined manner, although more than two leading slashes "
"shall be treated as a single slash.\"*"
msgstr ""

msgid "The concatenation of the drive and root::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An immutable sequence providing access to the logical ancestors of the path::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The parents sequence now supports :term:`slices <slice>` and negative index "
"values."
msgstr ""

msgid "The logical parent of the path::"
msgstr ""

msgid "You cannot go past an anchor, or empty path::"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is a purely lexical operation, hence the following behaviour::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to walk an arbitrary filesystem path upwards, it is recommended "
"to first call :meth:`Path.resolve` so as to resolve symlinks and eliminate "
"``\"..\"`` components."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A string representing the final path component, excluding the drive and "
"root, if any::"
msgstr ""

msgid "UNC drive names are not considered::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The file extension of the final component, if any::"
msgstr ""

msgid "A list of the path's file extensions::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The final path component, without its suffix::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a string representation of the path with forward slashes (``/``)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Represent the path as a ``file`` URI.  :exc:`ValueError` is raised if the "
"path isn't absolute."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return whether the path is absolute or not.  A path is considered absolute "
"if it has both a root and (if the flavour allows) a drive::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Return whether or not this path is relative to the *other* path."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With :class:`PureWindowsPath`, return ``True`` if the path is considered "
"reserved under Windows, ``False`` otherwise.  With :class:`PurePosixPath`, "
"``False`` is always returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"File system calls on reserved paths can fail mysteriously or have unintended "
"effects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Calling this method is equivalent to combining the path with each of the "
"*other* arguments in turn::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Match this path against the provided glob-style pattern.  Return ``True`` if "
"matching is successful, ``False`` otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *pattern* is relative, the path can be either relative or absolute, and "
"matching is done from the right::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *pattern* is absolute, the path must be absolute, and the whole path must "
"match::"
msgstr ""

msgid "As with other methods, case-sensitivity follows platform defaults::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Compute a version of this path relative to the path represented by *other*.  "
"If it's impossible, ValueError is raised::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NOTE: This function is part of :class:`PurePath` and works with strings. It "
"does not check or access the underlying file structure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a new path with the :attr:`name` changed.  If the original path "
"doesn't have a name, ValueError is raised::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a new path with the :attr:`stem` changed.  If the original path "
"doesn't have a name, ValueError is raised::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a new path with the :attr:`suffix` changed.  If the original path "
"doesn't have a suffix, the new *suffix* is appended instead.  If the "
"*suffix* is an empty string, the original suffix is removed::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Concrete paths"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Concrete paths are subclasses of the pure path classes.  In addition to "
"operations provided by the latter, they also provide methods to do system "
"calls on path objects.  There are three ways to instantiate concrete paths:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A subclass of :class:`PurePath`, this class represents concrete paths of the "
"system's path flavour (instantiating it creates either a :class:`PosixPath` "
"or a :class:`WindowsPath`)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A subclass of :class:`Path` and :class:`PurePosixPath`, this class "
"represents concrete non-Windows filesystem paths::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A subclass of :class:`Path` and :class:`PureWindowsPath`, this class "
"represents concrete Windows filesystem paths::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can only instantiate the class flavour that corresponds to your system "
"(allowing system calls on non-compatible path flavours could lead to bugs or "
"failures in your application)::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Methods"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Concrete paths provide the following methods in addition to pure paths "
"methods.  Many of these methods can raise an :exc:`OSError` if a system call "
"fails (for example because the path doesn't exist)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`~Path.exists()`, :meth:`~Path.is_dir()`, :meth:`~Path.is_file()`, :"
"meth:`~Path.is_mount()`, :meth:`~Path.is_symlink()`, :meth:`~Path."
"is_block_device()`, :meth:`~Path.is_char_device()`, :meth:`~Path."
"is_fifo()`, :meth:`~Path.is_socket()` now return ``False`` instead of "
"raising an exception for paths that contain characters unrepresentable at "
"the OS level."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a new path object representing the current directory (as returned by :"
"func:`os.getcwd`)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a new path object representing the user's home directory (as returned "
"by :func:`os.path.expanduser` with ``~`` construct). If the home directory "
"can't be resolved, :exc:`RuntimeError` is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a :class:`os.stat_result` object containing information about this "
"path, like :func:`os.stat`. The result is looked up at each call to this "
"method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method normally follows symlinks; to stat a symlink add the argument "
"``follow_symlinks=False``, or use :meth:`~Path.lstat`."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *follow_symlinks* parameter was added."
msgstr ""

msgid "Change the file mode and permissions, like :func:`os.chmod`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method normally follows symlinks. Some Unix flavours support changing "
"permissions on the symlink itself; on these platforms you may add the "
"argument ``follow_symlinks=False``, or use :meth:`~Path.lchmod`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Whether the path points to an existing file or directory::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the path points to a symlink, :meth:`exists` returns whether the symlink "
"*points to* an existing file or directory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a new path with expanded ``~`` and ``~user`` constructs, as returned "
"by :meth:`os.path.expanduser`. If a home directory can't be resolved, :exc:"
"`RuntimeError` is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Glob the given relative *pattern* in the directory represented by this path, "
"yielding all matching files (of any kind)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Patterns are the same as for :mod:`fnmatch`, with the addition of \"``**``\" "
"which means \"this directory and all subdirectories, recursively\".  In "
"other words, it enables recursive globbing::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using the \"``**``\" pattern in large directory trees may consume an "
"inordinate amount of time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``pathlib.Path.glob`` with "
"arguments ``self``, ``pattern``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return only directories if *pattern* ends with a pathname components "
"separator (:data:`~os.sep` or :data:`~os.altsep`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the name of the group owning the file.  :exc:`KeyError` is raised if "
"the file's gid isn't found in the system database."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if the path points to a directory (or a symbolic link "
"pointing to a directory), ``False`` if it points to another kind of file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``False`` is also returned if the path doesn't exist or is a broken symlink; "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if the path points to a regular file (or a symbolic link "
"pointing to a regular file), ``False`` if it points to another kind of file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if the path is a :dfn:`mount point`: a point in a file "
"system where a different file system has been mounted.  On POSIX, the "
"function checks whether *path*'s parent, :file:`path/..`, is on a different "
"device than *path*, or whether :file:`path/..` and *path* point to the same "
"i-node on the same device --- this should detect mount points for all Unix "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if the path points to a symbolic link, ``False`` otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``False`` is also returned if the path doesn't exist; other errors (such as "
"permission errors) are propagated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if the path points to a Unix socket (or a symbolic link "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if the path points to a FIFO (or a symbolic link pointing to "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the path points to a directory, yield path objects of the directory "
"contents::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The children are yielded in arbitrary order, and the special entries ``'.'`` "
