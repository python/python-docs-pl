"This module offers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics "
"appropriate for different operating systems.  Path classes are divided "
"between :ref:`pure paths <pure-paths>`, which provide purely computational "
"operations without I/O, and :ref:`concrete paths <concrete-paths>`, which "
"inherit from pure paths but also provide I/O operations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Inheritance diagram showing the classes available in pathlib. The\n"
"most basic class is PurePath, which has three direct subclasses:\n"
"PurePosixPath, PureWindowsPath, and Path. Further to these four\n"
"classes, there are two classes that use multiple inheritance:\n"
"PosixPath subclasses PurePosixPath and Path, and WindowsPath\n"
"subclasses PureWindowsPath and Path."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you've never used this module before or just aren't sure which class is "
"right for your task, :class:`Path` is most likely what you need. It "
"instantiates a :ref:`concrete path <concrete-paths>` for the platform the "
"code is running on."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pure paths are useful in some special cases; for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to manipulate Windows paths on a Unix machine (or vice versa). "
"You cannot instantiate a :class:`WindowsPath` when running on Unix, but you "
"can instantiate :class:`PureWindowsPath`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You want to make sure that your code only manipulates paths without actually "
"accessing the OS. In this case, instantiating one of the pure classes may be "
"useful since those simply don't have any OS-accessing operations."

msgid "Pure paths"

msgid ""
"Pure path objects provide path-handling operations which don't actually "
"access a filesystem.  There are three ways to access these classes, which we "
"also call *flavours*:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A generic class that represents the system's path flavour (instantiating it "
"creates either a :class:`PurePosixPath` or a :class:`PureWindowsPath`)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each element of *pathsegments* can be either a string representing a path "
"segment, or an object implementing the :class:`os.PathLike` interface where "
"the :meth:`~os.PathLike.__fspath__` method returns a string, such as another "
"path object::"
msgstr ""

msgid "When *pathsegments* is empty, the current directory is assumed::"
msgstr ""

"If a segment is an absolute path, all previous segments are ignored (like :"
"func:`os.path.join`)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, the drive is not reset when a rooted relative path segment (e."
"g., ``r'\\foo'``) is encountered::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Spurious slashes and single dots are collapsed, but double dots (``'..'``) "
"and leading double slashes (``'//'``) are not, since this would change the "
"meaning of a path for various reasons (e.g. symbolic links, UNC paths)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"(a naïve approach would make ``PurePosixPath('foo/../bar')`` equivalent to "
"``PurePosixPath('bar')``, which is wrong if ``foo`` is a symbolic link to "
"another directory)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pure path objects implement the :class:`os.PathLike` interface, allowing "
"them to be used anywhere the interface is accepted."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support for the :class:`os.PathLike` interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A subclass of :class:`PurePath`, this path flavour represents non-Windows "

msgid ""
"A subclass of :class:`PurePath`, this path flavour represents Windows "
"filesystem paths, including `UNC paths`_::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Regardless of the system you're running on, you can instantiate all of these "
"classes, since they don't provide any operation that does system calls."
msgstr ""

msgid "General properties"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Paths are immutable and :term:`hashable`.  Paths of a same flavour are "
"comparable and orderable.  These properties respect the flavour's case-"
"folding semantics::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Paths of a different flavour compare unequal and cannot be ordered::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Operators"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The slash operator helps create child paths, like :func:`os.path.join`. If "
"the argument is an absolute path, the previous path is ignored. On Windows, "
"the drive is not reset when the argument is a rooted relative path (e.g., "
"``r'\\foo'``)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A path object can be used anywhere an object implementing :class:`os."
"PathLike` is accepted::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The string representation of a path is the raw filesystem path itself (in "
"native form, e.g. with backslashes under Windows), which you can pass to any "
"function taking a file path as a string::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly, calling :class:`bytes` on a path gives the raw filesystem path as "
"a bytes object, as encoded by :func:`os.fsencode`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Calling :class:`bytes` is only recommended under Unix.  Under Windows, the "
"unicode form is the canonical representation of filesystem paths."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accessing individual parts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To access the individual \"parts\" (components) of a path, use the following "
"property:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A tuple giving access to the path's various components::"
msgstr ""

msgid "(note how the drive and local root are regrouped in a single part)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Methods and properties"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pure paths provide the following methods and properties:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The implementation of the :mod:`os.path` module used for low-level path "
"parsing and joining: either :mod:`posixpath` or :mod:`ntpath`."

msgid "UNC shares always have a root::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the path starts with more than two successive slashes, :class:`~pathlib."
"PurePosixPath` collapses them::"
msgstr ""

"This behavior conforms to *The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6*, "

"If you want to walk an arbitrary filesystem path upwards, it is recommended "
"to first call :meth:`Path.resolve` so as to resolve symlinks and eliminate "
"``\"..\"`` components."

"Passing additional arguments is deprecated; if supplied, they are joined "
"with *other*."

"considered reserved. UNC paths may be reserved."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is deprecated; use :func:`os.path.isreserved` to detect reserved "
"paths on Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Calling this method is equivalent to combining the path with each of the "
"given *pathsegments* in turn::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Match this path against the provided glob-style pattern.  Return ``True`` if "
"matching is successful, ``False`` otherwise.  For example::"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is part of :class:`PurePath` and works with strings. It does "

"*walk_up* option as it assumes that no symlinks are present in the path; "
"call :meth:`~Path.resolve` first if necessary to resolve symlinks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *walk_up* parameter was added (old behavior is the same as "

msgid ""
"Create a new path object of the same type by combining the given "

msgstr ""

msgid "Concrete paths"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Concrete paths are subclasses of the pure path classes.  In addition to "
