msgid ":mod:`msvcrt` --- Useful routines from the MS VC++ runtime"

msgid ""
"These functions provide access to some useful capabilities on Windows "
"platforms. Some higher-level modules use these functions to build the  "
"Windows implementations of their services.  For example, the :mod:`getpass` "
"module uses this in the implementation of the :func:`getpass` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Further documentation on these functions can be found in the Platform API "
"documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module implements both the normal and wide char variants of the console "
"I/O api. The normal API deals only with ASCII characters and is of limited "
"use for internationalized applications. The wide char API should be used "
"where ever possible."

"Lock part of a file based on file descriptor *fd* from the C runtime.  "
"Raises :exc:`OSError` on failure.  The locked region of the file extends "
"from the current file position for *nbytes* bytes, and may continue beyond "
"the end of the file.  *mode* must be one of the :const:`LK_\\*` constants "
"listed below. Multiple regions in a file may be locked at the same time, but "
"may not overlap.  Adjacent regions are not merged; they must be unlocked "
"individually."
