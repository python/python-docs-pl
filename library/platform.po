msgid ":mod:`platform` ---  Access to underlying platform's identifying data"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/platform.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Specific platforms listed alphabetically, with Linux included in the Unix "
"section."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cross Platform"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Queries the given executable (defaults to the Python interpreter binary) for "
"various architecture information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a tuple ``(bits, linkage)`` which contain information about the bit "
"architecture and the linkage format used for the executable. Both values are "
"returned as strings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Values that cannot be determined are returned as given by the parameter "
"presets. If bits is given as ``''``, the ``sizeof(pointer)`` (or "
"``sizeof(long)`` on Python version < 1.5.2) is used as indicator for the "
"supported pointer size."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function relies on the system's :file:`file` command to do the actual "
"work. This is available on most if not all Unix  platforms and some non-Unix "
"platforms and then only if the executable points to the Python interpreter.  "
"Reasonable defaults are used when the above needs are not met."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On macOS (and perhaps other platforms), executable files may be universal "
"files containing multiple architectures."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get at the \"64-bitness\" of the current interpreter, it is more reliable "
"to query the :attr:`sys.maxsize` attribute::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns the machine type, e.g. ``'AMD64'``. An empty string is returned if "
"the value cannot be determined."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns the computer's network name (may not be fully qualified!). An empty "
"string is returned if the value cannot be determined."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a single string identifying the underlying platform with as much "
"useful information as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The output is intended to be *human readable* rather than machine parseable. "
"It may look different on different platforms and this is intended."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *aliased* is true, the function will use aliases for various platforms "
"that report system names which differ from their common names, for example "
"SunOS will be reported as Solaris.  The :func:`system_alias` function is "
"used to implement this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting *terse* to true causes the function to return only the absolute "
"minimum information needed to identify the platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On macOS, the function now uses :func:`mac_ver`, if it returns a non-empty "
"release string, to get the macOS version rather than the darwin version."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns the (real) processor name, e.g. ``'amdk6'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An empty string is returned if the value cannot be determined. Note that "
"many platforms do not provide this information or simply return the same "
"value as for :func:`machine`.  NetBSD does this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a tuple ``(buildno, builddate)`` stating the Python build number and "
"date as strings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns a string identifying the compiler used for compiling Python."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns a string identifying the Python implementation SCM branch."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a string identifying the Python implementation. Possible return "
"values are: 'CPython', 'IronPython', 'Jython', 'PyPy'."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns a string identifying the Python implementation SCM revision."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns the Python version as string ``'major.minor.patchlevel'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that unlike the Python ``sys.version``, the returned value will always "
"include the patchlevel (it defaults to 0)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns the Python version as tuple ``(major, minor, patchlevel)`` of "
"strings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that unlike the Python ``sys.version``, the returned value will always "
"include the patchlevel (it defaults to ``'0'``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns the system's release, e.g. ``'2.2.0'`` or ``'NT'``. An empty string "
"is returned if the value cannot be determined."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns the system/OS name, such as ``'Linux'``, ``'Darwin'``, ``'Java'``, "
"``'Windows'``. An empty string is returned if the value cannot be determined."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns ``(system, release, version)`` aliased to common marketing names "
"used for some systems.  It also does some reordering of the information in "
"some cases where it would otherwise cause confusion."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns the system's release version, e.g. ``'#3 on degas'``. An empty "
"string is returned if the value cannot be determined."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Fairly portable uname interface. Returns a :func:`~collections.namedtuple` "
"containing six attributes: :attr:`system`, :attr:`node`, :attr:`release`, :"
"attr:`version`, :attr:`machine`, and :attr:`processor`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that this adds a sixth attribute (:attr:`processor`) not present in "
"the :func:`os.uname` result.  Also, the attribute names are different for "
"the first two attributes; :func:`os.uname` names them :attr:`sysname` and :"
"attr:`nodename`."

msgid "Entries which cannot be determined are set to ``''``."

msgid "Result changed from a tuple to a :func:`~collections.namedtuple`."

msgid ""
"Returns a tuple ``(release, vendor, vminfo, osinfo)`` with *vminfo* being a "
"tuple ``(vm_name, vm_release, vm_vendor)`` and *osinfo* being a tuple "
"``(os_name, os_version, os_arch)``. Values which cannot be determined are "

"Get additional version information from the Windows Registry and return a "

"parameters (which all default to an empty string)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a hint: *ptype* is ``'Uniprocessor Free'`` on single processor NT "
"machines and ``'Multiprocessor Free'`` on multi processor machines. The "
"*'Free'* refers to the OS version being free of debugging code. It could "
"also state *'Checked'* which means the OS version uses debugging code, i.e. "
"code that checks arguments, ranges, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a string representing the current Windows edition, or ``None`` if "

"Tries to determine the libc version against which the file executable "
"(defaults to the Python interpreter) is linked.  Returns a tuple of strings "

"defined according to the standard. All other fields are optional. Vendors "
"may include additional fields."
