msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/selectors.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Wprowadzenie"

msgid ""
"This module allows high-level and efficient I/O multiplexing, built upon "
"the :mod:`select` module primitives. Users are encouraged to use this module "
"instead, unless they want precise control over the OS-level primitives used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It defines a :class:`BaseSelector` abstract base class, along with several "
"concrete implementations (:class:`KqueueSelector`, :class:"
"`EpollSelector`...), that can be used to wait for I/O readiness notification "
"on multiple file objects. In the following, \"file object\" refers to any "
"object with a :meth:`fileno()` method, or a raw file descriptor. See :term:"
"`file object`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`DefaultSelector` is an alias to the most efficient implementation "
"available on the current platform: this should be the default choice for "
"most users."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The type of file objects supported depends on the platform: on Windows, "
"sockets are supported, but not pipes, whereas on Unix, both are supported "
"(some other types may be supported as well, such as fifos or special file "
"devices)."

"A :class:`SelectorKey` is a :class:`~collections.namedtuple` used to "

msgid ""
"A :class:`BaseSelector` is used to wait for I/O event readiness on multiple "
"file objects. It supports file stream registration, unregistration, and a "
"method to wait for I/O events on those streams, with an optional timeout. "
"It's an abstract base class, so cannot be instantiated. Use :class:"
"`DefaultSelector` instead, or one of :class:`SelectSelector`, :class:"
"`KqueueSelector` etc. if you want to specifically use an implementation, and "
"your platform supports it. :class:`BaseSelector` and its concrete "
"implementations support the :term:`context manager` protocol."

msgid ""
"*fileobj* is the file object to monitor.  It may either be an integer file "
"descriptor or an object with a ``fileno()`` method. *events* is a bitwise "
"mask of events to monitor. *data* is an opaque object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This returns a new :class:`SelectorKey` instance, or raises a :exc:"
"`ValueError` in case of invalid event mask or file descriptor, or :exc:"
"`KeyError` if the file object is already registered."

"Unregister a file object from selection, removing it from monitoring. A file "
"object shall be unregistered prior to being closed."

msgid "*fileobj* must be a file object previously registered."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This returns the associated :class:`SelectorKey` instance, or raises a :exc:"
"`KeyError` if *fileobj* is not registered.  It will raise :exc:`ValueError` "
"if *fileobj* is invalid (e.g. it has no ``fileno()`` method or its "
"``fileno()`` method has an invalid return value)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Change a registered file object's monitored events or attached data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is equivalent to :meth:`BaseSelector.unregister(fileobj)` followed by :"
"meth:`BaseSelector.register(fileobj, events, data)`, except that it can be "
"implemented more efficiently."

"Wait until some registered file objects become ready, or the timeout expires."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``timeout > 0``, this specifies the maximum wait time, in seconds. If "

"file objects. If *timeout* is ``None``, the call will block until a "
"monitored file object becomes ready."

"has elapsed if the current process receives a signal: in this case, an empty "
"list will be returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The selector is now retried with a recomputed timeout when interrupted by a "
"signal if the signal handler did not raise an exception (see :pep:`475` for "
"the rationale), instead of returning an empty list of events before the "
"timeout."
