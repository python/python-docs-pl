msgid ":mod:`html.parser` --- Simple HTML and XHTML parser"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/html/parser.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module defines a class :class:`HTMLParser` which serves as the basis "
"for parsing text files formatted in HTML (HyperText Mark-up Language) and "
"XHTML."
msgstr ""

msgid "Create a parser instance able to parse invalid markup."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *convert_charrefs* is ``True`` (the default), all character references "
"(except the ones in ``script``/``style`` elements) are automatically "
"converted to the corresponding Unicode characters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An :class:`.HTMLParser` instance is fed HTML data and calls handler methods "
"when start tags, end tags, text, comments, and other markup elements are "
"encountered.  The user should subclass :class:`.HTMLParser` and override its "
"methods to implement the desired behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This parser does not check that end tags match start tags or call the end-"
"tag handler for elements which are closed implicitly by closing an outer "
"element."
msgstr ""

msgid "*convert_charrefs* keyword argument added."
msgstr ""

msgid "The default value for argument *convert_charrefs* is now ``True``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example HTML Parser Application"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a basic example, below is a simple HTML parser that uses the :class:"
"`HTMLParser` class to print out start tags, end tags, and data as they are "
"encountered::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The output will then be:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`.HTMLParser` Methods"
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`HTMLParser` instances have the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Feed some text to the parser.  It is processed insofar as it consists of "
"complete elements; incomplete data is buffered until more data is fed or :"
"meth:`close` is called.  *data* must be :class:`str`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Force processing of all buffered data as if it were followed by an end-of-"
"file mark.  This method may be redefined by a derived class to define "
"additional processing at the end of the input, but the redefined version "
"should always call the :class:`HTMLParser` base class method :meth:`close`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Reset the instance.  Loses all unprocessed data.  This is called implicitly "
"at instantiation time."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return current line number and offset."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the text of the most recently opened start tag.  This should not "
"normally be needed for structured processing, but may be useful in dealing "
"with HTML \"as deployed\" or for re-generating input with minimal changes "
"(whitespace between attributes can be preserved, etc.)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following methods are called when data or markup elements are "
"encountered and they are meant to be overridden in a subclass.  The base "
"class implementations do nothing (except for :meth:`~HTMLParser."
"handle_startendtag`):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is called to handle the start tag of an element (e.g. ``<div "
"id=\"main\">``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *tag* argument is the name of the tag converted to lower case. The "
"*attrs* argument is a list of ``(name, value)`` pairs containing the "
"attributes found inside the tag's ``<>`` brackets.  The *name* will be "
"translated to lower case, and quotes in the *value* have been removed, and "
"character and entity references have been replaced."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For instance, for the tag ``<A HREF=\"https://www.cwi.nl/\">``, this method "
"would be called as ``handle_starttag('a', [('href', 'https://www.cwi."
"nl/')])``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All entity references from :mod:`html.entities` are replaced in the "
"attribute values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is called to handle the end tag of an element (e.g. ``</div>``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *tag* argument is the name of the tag converted to lower case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :meth:`handle_starttag`, but called when the parser encounters an "
"XHTML-style empty tag (``<img ... />``).  This method may be overridden by "
"subclasses which require this particular lexical information; the default "
"implementation simply calls :meth:`handle_starttag` and :meth:"
"`handle_endtag`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is called to process arbitrary data (e.g. text nodes and the "
"content of ``<script>...</script>`` and ``<style>...</style>``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is called to process a named character reference of the form "
"``&name;`` (e.g. ``&gt;``), where *name* is a general entity reference (e.g. "
"``'gt'``).  This method is never called if *convert_charrefs* is ``True``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is called to process decimal and hexadecimal numeric character "
"references of the form ``&#NNN;`` and ``&#xNNN;``.  For example, the decimal "
"equivalent for ``&gt;`` is ``&#62;``, whereas the hexadecimal is ``&#x3E;``; "
"in this case the method will receive ``'62'`` or ``'x3E'``.  This method is "
"never called if *convert_charrefs* is ``True``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is called when a comment is encountered (e.g. ``<!--comment--"
">``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, the comment ``<!-- comment -->`` will cause this method to be "
"called with the argument ``' comment '``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The content of Internet Explorer conditional comments (condcoms) will also "
"be sent to this method, so, for ``<!--[if IE 9]>IE9-specific content<!"
"[endif]-->``, this method will receive ``'[if IE 9]>IE9-specific content<!"
"[endif]'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is called to handle an HTML doctype declaration (e.g. ``<!"
"DOCTYPE html>``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *decl* parameter will be the entire contents of the declaration inside "
"the ``<!...>`` markup (e.g. ``'DOCTYPE html'``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Method called when a processing instruction is encountered.  The *data* "
"parameter will contain the entire processing instruction. For example, for "
"the processing instruction ``<?proc color='red'>``, this method would be "
"called as ``handle_pi(\"proc color='red'\")``.  It is intended to be "
"overridden by a derived class; the base class implementation does nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`HTMLParser` class uses the SGML syntactic rules for processing "
"instructions.  An XHTML processing instruction using the trailing ``'?'`` "
"will cause the ``'?'`` to be included in *data*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is called when an unrecognized declaration is read by the parser."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *data* parameter will be the entire contents of the declaration inside "
"the ``<![...]>`` markup.  It is sometimes useful to be overridden by a "
"derived class.  The base class implementation does nothing."
