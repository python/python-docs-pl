msgid ""
"The :mod:`winsound` module provides access to the basic sound-playing "
"machinery provided by Windows platforms.  It includes functions and several "
"constants."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Beep the PC's speaker. The *frequency* parameter specifies frequency, in "
"hertz, of the sound, and must be in the range 37 through 32,767. The "
"*duration* parameter specifies the number of milliseconds the sound should "
"last.  If the system is not able to beep the speaker, :exc:`RuntimeError` is "
"raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Call the underlying :c:func:`PlaySound` function from the Platform API.  The "
"*sound* parameter may be a filename, a system sound alias, audio data as a :"
"term:`bytes-like object`, or ``None``.  Its interpretation depends on the "
"value of *flags*, which can be a bitwise ORed combination of the constants "
"described below. If the *sound* parameter is ``None``, any currently playing "
"waveform sound is stopped. If the system indicates an error, :exc:"
"`RuntimeError` is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Call the underlying :c:func:`MessageBeep` function from the Platform API.  "
"This plays a sound as specified in the registry.  The *type* argument "
"specifies which sound to play; possible values are ``-1``, "
"``MB_ICONASTERISK``, ``MB_ICONEXCLAMATION``, ``MB_ICONHAND``, "
"``MB_ICONQUESTION``, and ``MB_OK``, all described below.  The value ``-1`` "
"produces a \"simple beep\"; this is the final fallback if a sound cannot be "
"played otherwise.  If the system indicates an error, :exc:`RuntimeError` is "
"raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *sound* parameter is the name of a WAV file. Do not use with :const:"
"`SND_ALIAS`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *sound* parameter is a sound association name from the registry.  If the "
"registry contains no such name, play the system default sound unless :const:"
"`SND_NODEFAULT` is also specified. If no default sound is registered, raise :"
"exc:`RuntimeError`. Do not use with :const:`SND_FILENAME`."
