msgid ""
"This module defines a standard interface to break Uniform Resource Locator "
"(URL) strings up in components (addressing scheme, network location, path "
"etc.), to combine the components back into a URL string, and to convert a "
"\"relative URL\" to an absolute URL given a \"base URL.\""
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module has been designed to match the internet RFC on Relative Uniform "
"Resource Locators. It supports the following URL schemes: ``file``, ``ftp``, "
"``gopher``, ``hdl``, ``http``, ``https``, ``imap``, ``mailto``, ``mms``, "
"``news``, ``nntp``, ``prospero``, ``rsync``, ``rtsp``, ``rtspu``, ``sftp``, "

"The :mod:`urllib.parse` module defines functions that fall into two broad "
"categories: URL parsing and URL quoting. These are covered in detail in the "
"following sections."
msgstr ""

msgid "URL Parsing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The URL parsing functions focus on splitting a URL string into its "
"components, or on combining URL components into a URL string."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Parse a URL into six components, returning a 6-item :term:`named tuple`.  "
"This corresponds to the general structure of a URL: ``scheme://netloc/path;"
"parameters?query#fragment``. Each tuple item is a string, possibly empty. "
"The components are not broken up into smaller parts (for example, the "
"network location is a single string), and % escapes are not expanded. The "
"delimiters as shown above are not part of the result, except for a leading "
"slash in the *path* component, which is retained if present.  For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Following the syntax specifications in :rfc:`1808`, urlparse recognizes a "
"netloc only if it is properly introduced by '//'.  Otherwise the input is "
"presumed to be a relative URL and thus to start with a path component."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *scheme* argument gives the default addressing scheme, to be used only "
"if the URL does not specify one.  It should be the same type (text or bytes) "
"as *urlstring*, except that the default value ``''`` is always allowed, and "
"is automatically converted to ``b''`` if appropriate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the *allow_fragments* argument is false, fragment identifiers are not "
"recognized.  Instead, they are parsed as part of the path, parameters or "
"query component, and :attr:`fragment` is set to the empty string in the "
"return value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The return value is a :term:`named tuple`, which means that its items can be "
"accessed by index or as named attributes, which are:"

msgstr ""

msgid "Added IPv6 URL parsing capabilities."

"states that these are equivalent)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is similar to :func:`urlparse`, but does not split the params from the "
"URL. This should generally be used instead of :func:`urlparse` if the more "
"recent URL syntax allowing parameters to be applied to each segment of the "
"*path* portion of the URL (see :rfc:`2396`) is wanted.  A separate function "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Construct a full (\"absolute\") URL by combining a \"base URL\" (*base*) "

"without changes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parsing ASCII Encoded Bytes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The URL parsing functions were originally designed to operate on character "
"strings only. In practice, it is useful to be able to manipulate properly "
"quoted and encoded URLs as sequences of ASCII bytes. Accordingly, the URL "
"parsing functions in this module all operate on :class:`bytes` and :class:"
"`bytearray` objects in addition to :class:`str` objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If :class:`str` data is passed in, the result will also contain only :class:"
"`str` data. If :class:`bytes` or :class:`bytearray` data is passed in, the "
"result will contain only :class:`bytes` data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Attempting to mix :class:`str` data with :class:`bytes` or :class:"
"`bytearray` in a single function call will result in a :exc:`TypeError` "
"being raised, while attempting to pass in non-ASCII byte values will "
"trigger :exc:`UnicodeDecodeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To support easier conversion of result objects between :class:`str` and :"
"class:`bytes`, all return values from URL parsing functions provide either "
"an :meth:`encode` method (when the result contains :class:`str` data) or a :"
"meth:`decode` method (when the result contains :class:`bytes` data). The "
"signatures of these methods match those of the corresponding :class:`str` "
"and :class:`bytes` methods (except that the default encoding is ``'ascii'`` "
"rather than ``'utf-8'``). Each produces a value of a corresponding type that "
"contains either :class:`bytes` data (for :meth:`encode` methods) or :class:"
"`str` data (for :meth:`decode` methods)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Applications that need to operate on potentially improperly quoted URLs that "
"may contain non-ASCII data will need to do their own decoding from bytes to "
"characters before invoking the URL parsing methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The behaviour described in this section applies only to the URL parsing "
"functions. The URL quoting functions use their own rules when producing or "
"consuming byte sequences as detailed in the documentation of the individual "
"URL quoting functions."
msgstr ""

msgid "URL parsing functions now accept ASCII encoded byte sequences"
msgstr ""

msgid "Structured Parse Results"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The result objects from the :func:`urlparse`, :func:`urlsplit`  and :func:"
"`urldefrag` functions are subclasses of the :class:`tuple` type. These "
"subclasses add the attributes listed in the documentation for those "
"functions, the encoding and decoding support described in the previous "
"section, as well as an additional method:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the re-combined version of the original URL as a string. This may "
"differ from the original URL in that the scheme may be normalized to lower "
"case and empty components may be dropped. Specifically, empty parameters, "
"queries, and fragment identifiers will be removed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For :func:`urldefrag` results, only empty fragment identifiers will be "
"removed. For :func:`urlsplit` and :func:`urlparse` results, all noted "
"changes will be made to the URL returned by this method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The result of this method remains unchanged if passed back through the "
"original parsing function:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following classes provide the implementations of the structured parse "
"results when operating on :class:`str` objects:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Concrete class for :func:`urldefrag` results containing :class:`str` data. "
"The :meth:`encode` method returns a :class:`DefragResultBytes` instance."

msgid "URL Quoting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The URL quoting functions focus on taking program data and making it safe "
"for use as URL components by quoting special characters and appropriately "
"encoding non-ASCII text. They also support reversing these operations to "
"recreate the original data from the contents of a URL component if that task "
"isn't already covered by the URL parsing functions above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Replace special characters in *string* using the ``%xx`` escape. Letters, "
"digits, and the characters ``'_.-~'`` are never quoted. By default, this "
"function is intended for quoting the path section of a URL. The optional "

"quoted --- its default value is ``'/'``."
msgstr ""

msgid "*string* may be either a :class:`str` or a :class:`bytes` object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Moved from :rfc:`2396` to :rfc:`3986` for quoting URL strings. \"~\" is now "
