msgid ":mod:`mailbox` --- Manipulate mailboxes in various formats"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/mailbox.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module defines two classes, :class:`Mailbox` and :class:`Message`, for "
"accessing and manipulating on-disk mailboxes and the messages they contain. :"
"class:`Mailbox` offers a dictionary-like mapping from keys to messages. :"
"class:`Message` extends the :mod:`email.message` module's :class:`~email."
"message.Message` class with format-specific state and behavior. Supported "
"mailbox formats are Maildir, mbox, MH, Babyl, and MMDF."
msgstr ""

msgid "Module :mod:`email`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Represent and manipulate messages."
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`Mailbox` objects"
msgstr ""

msgid "A mailbox, which may be inspected and modified."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`Mailbox` class defines an interface and is not intended to be "
"instantiated.  Instead, format-specific subclasses should inherit from :"
"class:`Mailbox` and your code should instantiate a particular subclass."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`Mailbox` interface is dictionary-like, with small keys "
"corresponding to messages. Keys are issued by the :class:`Mailbox` instance "
"with which they will be used and are only meaningful to that :class:"
"`Mailbox` instance. A key continues to identify a message even if the "
"corresponding message is modified, such as by replacing it with another "
"message."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Messages may be added to a :class:`Mailbox` instance using the set-like "
"method :meth:`add` and removed using a ``del`` statement or the set-like "
"methods :meth:`remove` and :meth:`discard`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`Mailbox` interface semantics differ from dictionary semantics in "
"some noteworthy ways. Each time a message is requested, a new representation "
"(typically a :class:`Message` instance) is generated based upon the current "
"state of the mailbox. Similarly, when a message is added to a :class:"
"`Mailbox` instance, the provided message representation's contents are "
"copied. In neither case is a reference to the message representation kept by "
"the :class:`Mailbox` instance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default :class:`Mailbox` iterator iterates over message representations, "
"not keys as the default dictionary iterator does. Moreover, modification of "
"a mailbox during iteration is safe and well-defined. Messages added to the "
"mailbox after an iterator is created will not be seen by the iterator. "
"Messages removed from the mailbox before the iterator yields them will be "
"silently skipped, though using a key from an iterator may result in a :exc:"
"`KeyError` exception if the corresponding message is subsequently removed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Be very cautious when modifying mailboxes that might be simultaneously "
"changed by some other process.  The safest mailbox format to use for such "
"tasks is Maildir; try to avoid using single-file formats such as mbox for "
"concurrent writing.  If you're modifying a mailbox, you *must* lock it by "
"calling the :meth:`lock` and :meth:`unlock` methods *before* reading any "
"messages in the file or making any changes by adding or deleting a message.  "
"Failing to lock the mailbox runs the risk of losing messages or corrupting "
"the entire mailbox."
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`Mailbox` instances have the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add *message* to the mailbox and return the key that has been assigned to it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Parameter *message* may be a :class:`Message` instance, an :class:`email."
"message.Message` instance, a string, a byte string, or a file-like object "
"(which should be open in binary mode). If *message* is an instance of the "
"appropriate format-specific :class:`Message` subclass (e.g., if it's an :"
"class:`mboxMessage` instance and this is an :class:`mbox` instance), its "
"format-specific information is used. Otherwise, reasonable defaults for "
"format-specific information are used."
msgstr ""

msgid "Support for binary input was added."
msgstr ""

msgid "Delete the message corresponding to *key* from the mailbox."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If no such message exists, a :exc:`KeyError` exception is raised if the "
"method was called as :meth:`remove` or :meth:`__delitem__` but no exception "
"is raised if the method was called as :meth:`discard`. The behavior of :meth:"
"`discard` may be preferred if the underlying mailbox format supports "
"concurrent modification by other processes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Replace the message corresponding to *key* with *message*. Raise a :exc:"
"`KeyError` exception if no message already corresponds to *key*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As with :meth:`add`, parameter *message* may be a :class:`Message` instance, "
"an :class:`email.message.Message` instance, a string, a byte string, or a "
"file-like object (which should be open in binary mode). If *message* is an "
"instance of the appropriate format-specific :class:`Message` subclass (e.g., "
"if it's an :class:`mboxMessage` instance and this is an :class:`mbox` "
"instance), its format-specific information is used. Otherwise, the format-"
"specific information of the message that currently corresponds to *key* is "
"left unchanged."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return an iterator over all keys if called as :meth:`iterkeys` or return a "
"list of keys if called as :meth:`keys`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return an iterator over representations of all messages if called as :meth:"
"`itervalues` or :meth:`__iter__` or return a list of such representations if "
"called as :meth:`values`. The messages are represented as instances of the "
"appropriate format-specific :class:`Message` subclass unless a custom "
"message factory was specified when the :class:`Mailbox` instance was "
"initialized."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The behavior of :meth:`__iter__` is unlike that of dictionaries, which "
"iterate over keys."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return an iterator over (*key*, *message*) pairs, where *key* is a key and "
"*message* is a message representation, if called as :meth:`iteritems` or "
"return a list of such pairs if called as :meth:`items`. The messages are "
"represented as instances of the appropriate format-specific :class:`Message` "
"subclass unless a custom message factory was specified when the :class:"
"`Mailbox` instance was initialized."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a representation of the message corresponding to *key*. If no such "
"message exists, *default* is returned if the method was called as :meth:"
"`get` and a :exc:`KeyError` exception is raised if the method was called as :"
"meth:`__getitem__`. The message is represented as an instance of the "
"appropriate format-specific :class:`Message` subclass unless a custom "
"message factory was specified when the :class:`Mailbox` instance was "
"initialized."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a representation of the message corresponding to *key* as an instance "
"of the appropriate format-specific :class:`Message` subclass, or raise a :"
"exc:`KeyError` exception if no such message exists."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a byte representation of the message corresponding to *key*, or raise "
"a :exc:`KeyError` exception if no such message exists."

"processed through :class:`email.message.Message` to convert it to a 7bit "
"clean representation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a file-like representation of the message corresponding to *key*, or "
"raise a :exc:`KeyError` exception if no such message exists.  The file-like "
"object behaves as if open in binary mode.  This file should be closed once "
"it is no longer needed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The file object really is a binary file; previously it was incorrectly "

"management protocol: you can use a :keyword:`with` statement to "
"automatically close it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike other representations of messages, file-like representations are not "
"necessarily independent of the :class:`Mailbox` instance that created them "
"or of the underlying mailbox.  More specific documentation is provided by "
"each subclass."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return ``True`` if *key* corresponds to a message, ``False`` otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return a count of messages in the mailbox."
msgstr ""

msgid "Delete all messages from the mailbox."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a representation of the message corresponding to *key* and delete the "

"already correspond to a message in the mailbox or else a :exc:`KeyError` "
"exception will be raised, so in general it is incorrect for *arg* to be a :"
"class:`Mailbox` instance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unlike with dictionaries, keyword arguments are not supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Write any pending changes to the filesystem. For some :class:`Mailbox` "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Acquire an exclusive advisory lock on the mailbox so that other processes "
"know not to modify it. An :exc:`ExternalClashError` is raised if the lock is "
"not available. The particular locking mechanisms used depend upon the "

msgid ":class:`Maildir`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A subclass of :class:`Mailbox` for mailboxes in Maildir format. Parameter "
"*factory* is a callable object that accepts a file-like message "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is for historical reasons that *dirname* is named as such rather than "
"*path*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Maildir is a directory-based mailbox format invented for the qmail mail "
"transfer agent and now widely supported by other programs. Messages in a "
"Maildir mailbox are stored in separate files within a common directory "
"structure. This design allows Maildir mailboxes to be accessed and modified "
"by multiple unrelated programs without data corruption, so file locking is "
"unnecessary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Maildir mailboxes contain three subdirectories, namely: :file:`tmp`, :file:"
"`new`, and :file:`cur`. Messages are created momentarily in the :file:`tmp` "
"subdirectory and then moved to the :file:`new` subdirectory to finalize "
"delivery. A mail user agent may subsequently move the message to the :file:"
"`cur` subdirectory and store information about the state of the message in a "
"special \"info\" section appended to its file name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Folders of the style introduced by the Courier mail transfer agent are also "
"supported. Any subdirectory of the main mailbox is considered a folder if "
"``'.'`` is the first character in its name. Folder names are represented by :"
"class:`Maildir` without the leading ``'.'``. Each folder is itself a Maildir "
"mailbox but should not contain other folders. Instead, a logical nesting is "
"indicated using ``'.'`` to delimit levels, e.g., \"Archived.2005.07\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Maildir specification requires the use of a colon (``':'``) in certain "
"message file names. However, some operating systems do not permit this "
"character in file names, If you wish to use a Maildir-like format on such an "
"operating system, you should specify another character to use instead. The "
