msgid ":mod:`unittest` --- Unit testing framework"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/unittest/__init__.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"(If you are already familiar with the basic concepts of testing, you might "
"want to skip to :ref:`the list of assert methods <assert-methods>`.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`unittest` unit testing framework was originally inspired by JUnit "
"and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other "
"languages.  It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code "
"for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the "
"tests from the reporting framework."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To achieve this, :mod:`unittest` supports some important concepts in an "
"object-oriented way:"
msgstr ""

msgid "test fixture"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :dfn:`test fixture` represents the preparation needed to perform one or "
"more tests, and any associated cleanup actions.  This may involve, for "
"example, creating temporary or proxy databases, directories, or starting a "
"server process."
msgstr ""

msgid "test case"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :dfn:`test case` is the individual unit of testing.  It checks for a "
"specific response to a particular set of inputs.  :mod:`unittest` provides a "
"base class, :class:`TestCase`, which may be used to create new test cases."
msgstr ""

msgid "test suite"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :dfn:`test suite` is a collection of test cases, test suites, or both.  It "
"is used to aggregate tests that should be executed together."
msgstr ""

msgid "test runner"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :dfn:`test runner` is a component which orchestrates the execution of "
"tests and provides the outcome to the user.  The runner may use a graphical "
"interface, a textual interface, or return a special value to indicate the "
"results of executing the tests."
msgstr ""

msgid "Module :mod:`doctest`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Another test-support module with a very different flavor."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The script :file:`Tools/unittestgui/unittestgui.py` in the Python source "
"distribution is a GUI tool for test discovery and execution.  This is "
"intended largely for ease of use for those new to unit testing.  For "
"production environments it is recommended that tests be driven by a "
"continuous integration system such as `Buildbot <https://buildbot.net/>`_, "
"`Jenkins <https://www.jenkins.io/>`_, `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/"
"features/actions>`_, or `AppVeyor <https://www.appveyor.com/>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Basic example"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`unittest` module provides a rich set of tools for constructing and "
"running tests.  This section demonstrates that a small subset of the tools "
"suffice to meet the needs of most users."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is a short script to test three string methods::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A testcase is created by subclassing :class:`unittest.TestCase`.  The three "
"individual tests are defined with methods whose names start with the letters "
"``test``.  This naming convention informs the test runner about which "
"methods represent tests."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The crux of each test is a call to :meth:`~TestCase.assertEqual` to check "
"for an expected result; :meth:`~TestCase.assertTrue` or :meth:`~TestCase."
"assertFalse` to verify a condition; or :meth:`~TestCase.assertRaises` to "
"verify that a specific exception gets raised.  These methods are used "
"instead of the :keyword:`assert` statement so the test runner can accumulate "
"all test results and produce a report."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :meth:`~TestCase.setUp` and :meth:`~TestCase.tearDown` methods allow you "
"to define instructions that will be executed before and after each test "
"method. They are covered in more detail in the section :ref:`organizing-"
"tests`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The final block shows a simple way to run the tests. :func:`unittest.main` "
"provides a command-line interface to the test script.  When run from the "
"command line, the above script produces an output that looks like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Passing the ``-v`` option to your test script will instruct :func:`unittest."
"main` to enable a higher level of verbosity, and produce the following "
"output::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above examples show the most commonly used :mod:`unittest` features "
"which are sufficient to meet many everyday testing needs.  The remainder of "
"the documentation explores the full feature set from first principles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The behavior of returning a value from a test method (other than the default "
"``None`` value), is now deprecated."
msgstr ""

msgid "Command-Line Interface"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The unittest module can be used from the command line to run tests from "
"modules, classes or even individual test methods::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can pass in a list with any combination of module names, and fully "
"qualified class or method names."
msgstr ""

msgid "Test modules can be specified by file path as well::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This allows you to use the shell filename completion to specify the test "
"module. The file specified must still be importable as a module. The path is "
"converted to a module name by removing the '.py' and converting path "
"separators into '.'. If you want to execute a test file that isn't "
"importable as a module you should execute the file directly instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can run tests with more detail (higher verbosity) by passing in the -v "
"flag::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When executed without arguments :ref:`unittest-test-discovery` is started::"
msgstr ""

msgid "For a list of all the command-line options::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In earlier versions it was only possible to run individual test methods and "
"not modules or classes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Command-line options"
msgstr ""

msgid ":program:`unittest` supports these command-line options:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The standard output and standard error streams are buffered during the test "
"run. Output during a passing test is discarded. Output is echoed normally on "
"test fail or error and is added to the failure messages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":kbd:`Control-C` during the test run waits for the current test to end and "
"then reports all the results so far. A second :kbd:`Control-C` raises the "
"normal :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See `Signal Handling`_ for the functions that provide this functionality."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stop the test run on the first error or failure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Only run test methods and classes that match the pattern or substring. This "
"option may be used multiple times, in which case all test cases that match "
"any of the given patterns are included."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Patterns that contain a wildcard character (``*``) are matched against the "
"test name using :meth:`fnmatch.fnmatchcase`; otherwise simple case-sensitive "
"substring matching is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Patterns are matched against the fully qualified test method name as "
"imported by the test loader."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, ``-k foo`` matches ``foo_tests.SomeTest.test_something``, "
"``bar_tests.SomeTest.test_foo``, but not ``bar_tests.FooTest."
"test_something``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Show local variables in tracebacks."
msgstr ""

msgid "The command-line options ``-b``, ``-c`` and ``-f`` were added."
msgstr ""

msgid "The command-line option ``--locals``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The command-line option ``-k``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The command line can also be used for test discovery, for running all of the "
"tests in a project or just a subset."
msgstr ""

msgid "Test Discovery"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unittest supports simple test discovery. In order to be compatible with test "
"discovery, all of the test files must be :ref:`modules <tut-modules>` or :"
"ref:`packages <tut-packages>` importable from the top-level directory of the "
"project (this means that their filenames must be valid :ref:`identifiers "
"<identifiers>`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Test discovery is implemented in :meth:`TestLoader.discover`, but can also "
"be used from the command line. The basic command-line usage is::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a shortcut, ``python -m unittest`` is the equivalent of ``python -m "
"unittest discover``. If you want to pass arguments to test discovery the "
"``discover`` sub-command must be used explicitly."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``discover`` sub-command has the following options:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Verbose output"
msgstr ""

msgid "Directory to start discovery (``.`` default)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pattern to match test files (``test*.py`` default)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Top level directory of project (defaults to start directory)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :option:`-s`, :option:`-p`, and :option:`-t` options can be passed in as "
"positional arguments in that order. The following two command lines are "
"equivalent::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As well as being a path it is possible to pass a package name, for example "
"``myproject.subpackage.test``, as the start directory. The package name you "
"supply will then be imported and its location on the filesystem will be used "
"as the start directory."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Test discovery loads tests by importing them. Once test discovery has found "
"all the test files from the start directory you specify it turns the paths "
"into package names to import. For example :file:`foo/bar/baz.py` will be "
"imported as ``foo.bar.baz``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have a package installed globally and attempt test discovery on a "
"different copy of the package then the import *could* happen from the wrong "
"place. If this happens test discovery will warn you and exit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you supply the start directory as a package name rather than a path to a "
"directory then discover assumes that whichever location it imports from is "
"the location you intended, so you will not get the warning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Test modules and packages can customize test loading and discovery by "
"through the `load_tests protocol`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Test discovery supports :term:`namespace packages <namespace package>` for "
"the start directory. Note that you need to specify the top level directory "
"too (e.g. ``python -m unittest discover -s root/namespace -t root``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python 3.11 dropped the :term:`namespace packages <namespace package>` "
"support. It has been broken since Python 3.7. Start directory and "
"subdirectories containing tests must be regular package that have ``__init__."
"py`` file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Directories containing start directory still can be a namespace package. In "
"this case, you need to specify start directory as dotted package name, and "
"target directory explicitly. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Organizing test code"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The basic building blocks of unit testing are :dfn:`test cases` --- single "
"scenarios that must be set up and checked for correctness.  In :mod:"
"`unittest`, test cases are represented by :class:`unittest.TestCase` "
"instances. To make your own test cases you must write subclasses of :class:"
"`TestCase` or use :class:`FunctionTestCase`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The testing code of a :class:`TestCase` instance should be entirely self "
"contained, such that it can be run either in isolation or in arbitrary "
"combination with any number of other test cases."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The simplest :class:`TestCase` subclass will simply implement a test method "
"(i.e. a method whose name starts with ``test``) in order to perform specific "
"testing code::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that in order to test something, we use one of the :meth:`assert\\*` "
"methods provided by the :class:`TestCase` base class.  If the test fails, an "
"exception will be raised with an explanatory message, and :mod:`unittest` "
"will identify the test case as a :dfn:`failure`.  Any other exceptions will "
"be treated as :dfn:`errors`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tests can be numerous, and their set-up can be repetitive.  Luckily, we can "
"factor out set-up code by implementing a method called :meth:`~TestCase."
"setUp`, which the testing framework will automatically call for every single "
"test we run::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The order in which the various tests will be run is determined by sorting "
"the test method names with respect to the built-in ordering for strings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the :meth:`~TestCase.setUp` method raises an exception while the test is "
"running, the framework will consider the test to have suffered an error, and "
"the test method will not be executed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly, we can provide a :meth:`~TestCase.tearDown` method that tidies up "
"after the test method has been run::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If :meth:`~TestCase.setUp` succeeded, :meth:`~TestCase.tearDown` will be run "
"whether the test method succeeded or not."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Such a working environment for the testing code is called a :dfn:`test "
"fixture`.  A new TestCase instance is created as a unique test fixture used "
"to execute each individual test method.  Thus :meth:`~TestCase.setUp`, :meth:"
"`~TestCase.tearDown`, and :meth:`~TestCase.__init__` will be called once per "
"test."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is recommended that you use TestCase implementations to group tests "
"together according to the features they test.  :mod:`unittest` provides a "
"mechanism for this: the :dfn:`test suite`, represented by :mod:`unittest`'s :"
"class:`TestSuite` class.  In most cases, calling :func:`unittest.main` will "
"do the right thing and collect all the module's test cases for you and "
"execute them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, should you want to customize the building of your test suite, you "
"can do it yourself::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can place the definitions of test cases and test suites in the same "
"modules as the code they are to test (such as :file:`widget.py`), but there "
"are several advantages to placing the test code in a separate module, such "
"as :file:`test_widget.py`:"
msgstr ""

msgid "The test module can be run standalone from the command line."
msgstr ""

msgid "The test code can more easily be separated from shipped code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is less temptation to change test code to fit the code it tests "
"without a good reason."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Test code should be modified much less frequently than the code it tests."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tested code can be refactored more easily."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tests for modules written in C must be in separate modules anyway, so why "
"not be consistent?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the testing strategy changes, there is no need to change the source code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Re-using old test code"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some users will find that they have existing test code that they would like "
"to run from :mod:`unittest`, without converting every old test function to "
"a :class:`TestCase` subclass."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For this reason, :mod:`unittest` provides a :class:`FunctionTestCase` class. "
"This subclass of :class:`TestCase` can be used to wrap an existing test "
"function.  Set-up and tear-down functions can also be provided."
msgstr ""

msgid "Given the following test function::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"one can create an equivalent test case instance as follows, with optional "
"set-up and tear-down methods::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Even though :class:`FunctionTestCase` can be used to quickly convert an "
"existing test base over to a :mod:`unittest`\\ -based system, this approach "
"is not recommended.  Taking the time to set up proper :class:`TestCase` "
"subclasses will make future test refactorings infinitely easier."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In some cases, the existing tests may have been written using the :mod:"
"`doctest` module.  If so, :mod:`doctest` provides a :class:`DocTestSuite` "
"class that can automatically build :class:`unittest.TestSuite` instances "
"from the existing :mod:`doctest`\\ -based tests."
msgstr ""

msgid "Skipping tests and expected failures"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unittest supports skipping individual test methods and even whole classes of "
"tests.  In addition, it supports marking a test as an \"expected failure,\" "
"a test that is broken and will fail, but shouldn't be counted as a failure "
"on a :class:`TestResult`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Skipping a test is simply a matter of using the :func:`skip` :term:"
"`decorator` or one of its conditional variants, calling :meth:`TestCase."
"skipTest` within a :meth:`~TestCase.setUp` or test method, or raising :exc:"
"`SkipTest` directly."
msgstr ""

msgid "Basic skipping looks like this::"
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the output of running the example above in verbose mode::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Classes can be skipped just like methods::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`TestCase.setUp` can also skip the test.  This is useful when a "
"resource that needs to be set up is not available."
msgstr ""

msgid "Expected failures use the :func:`expectedFailure` decorator. ::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's easy to roll your own skipping decorators by making a decorator that "
"calls :func:`skip` on the test when it wants it to be skipped.  This "
"decorator skips the test unless the passed object has a certain attribute::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following decorators and exception implement test skipping and expected "
"failures:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unconditionally skip the decorated test.  *reason* should describe why the "
"test is being skipped."
msgstr ""

msgid "Skip the decorated test if *condition* is true."
msgstr ""

msgid "Skip the decorated test unless *condition* is true."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mark the test as an expected failure or error.  If the test fails or errors "
"in the test function itself (rather than in one of the :dfn:`test fixture` "
"methods) then it will be considered a success.  If the test passes, it will "
"be considered a failure."
msgstr ""

msgid "This exception is raised to skip a test."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Usually you can use :meth:`TestCase.skipTest` or one of the skipping "
"decorators instead of raising this directly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Skipped tests will not have :meth:`~TestCase.setUp` or :meth:`~TestCase."
"tearDown` run around them. Skipped classes will not have :meth:`~TestCase."
"setUpClass` or :meth:`~TestCase.tearDownClass` run. Skipped modules will not "
"have :func:`setUpModule` or :func:`tearDownModule` run."
msgstr ""

msgid "Distinguishing test iterations using subtests"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When there are very small differences among your tests, for instance some "
"parameters, unittest allows you to distinguish them inside the body of a "
"test method using the :meth:`~TestCase.subTest` context manager."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, the following test::"
msgstr ""

msgid "will produce the following output::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Without using a subtest, execution would stop after the first failure, and "
"the error would be less easy to diagnose because the value of ``i`` wouldn't "
"be displayed::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Classes and functions"
msgstr ""

msgid "This section describes in depth the API of :mod:`unittest`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Test cases"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instances of the :class:`TestCase` class represent the logical test units in "
"the :mod:`unittest` universe.  This class is intended to be used as a base "
"class, with specific tests being implemented by concrete subclasses.  This "
"class implements the interface needed by the test runner to allow it to "
"drive the tests, and methods that the test code can use to check for and "
"report various kinds of failure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each instance of :class:`TestCase` will run a single base method: the method "
"named *methodName*. In most uses of :class:`TestCase`, you will neither "
"change the *methodName* nor reimplement the default ``runTest()`` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`TestCase` can be instantiated successfully without providing a "
"*methodName*. This makes it easier to experiment with :class:`TestCase` from "
"the interactive interpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`TestCase` instances provide three groups of methods: one group used "
"to run the test, another used by the test implementation to check conditions "
"and report failures, and some inquiry methods allowing information about the "
"test itself to be gathered."
msgstr ""

msgid "Methods in the first group (running the test) are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Method called to prepare the test fixture.  This is called immediately "
"before calling the test method; other than :exc:`AssertionError` or :exc:"
"`SkipTest`, any exception raised by this method will be considered an error "
"rather than a test failure. The default implementation does nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Method called immediately after the test method has been called and the "
"result recorded.  This is called even if the test method raised an "
"exception, so the implementation in subclasses may need to be particularly "
"careful about checking internal state.  Any exception, other than :exc:"
"`AssertionError` or :exc:`SkipTest`, raised by this method will be "
"considered an additional error rather than a test failure (thus increasing "
"the total number of reported errors). This method will only be called if "
"the :meth:`setUp` succeeds, regardless of the outcome of the test method. "
"The default implementation does nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A class method called before tests in an individual class are run. "
"``setUpClass`` is called with the class as the only argument and must be "
"decorated as a :func:`classmethod`::"
msgstr ""

msgid "See `Class and Module Fixtures`_ for more details."

"object is created (by calling the :meth:`defaultTestResult` method) and "
"used. The result object is returned to :meth:`run`'s caller."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same effect may be had by simply calling the :class:`TestCase` instance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Previous versions of ``run`` did not return the result. Neither did calling "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Calling this during a test method or :meth:`setUp` skips the current test.  "
"See :ref:`unittest-skipping` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a context manager which executes the enclosed code block as a "
"subtest.  *msg* and *params* are optional, arbitrary values which are "

"arbitrarily nested."
msgstr ""

msgid "See :ref:`subtests` for more information."

"handling functionality within test frameworks."

msgid ""
"Install the control-c handler. When a :const:`signal.SIGINT` is received "
"(usually in response to the user pressing control-c) all registered results "
"have :meth:`~TestResult.stop` called."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Register a :class:`TestResult` object for control-c handling. Registering a "
"result stores a weak reference to it, so it doesn't prevent the result from "
"being garbage collected."

msgid ""
"Registering a :class:`TestResult` object has no side-effects if control-c "
"handling is not enabled, so test frameworks can unconditionally register all "
"results they create independently of whether or not handling is enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Remove a registered result. Once a result has been removed then :meth:"
"`~TestResult.stop` will no longer be called on that result object in "
"response to a control-c."

msgid ""
"When called without arguments this function removes the control-c handler if "
"it has been installed. This function can also be used as a test decorator to "
"temporarily remove the handler while the test is being executed::"
