"This section outlines high-level asyncio primitives to run asyncio code."

msgid ""
"They are built on top of an :ref:`event loop <asyncio-event-loop>` with the "
"aim to simplify async code usage for common wide-spread scenarios."

msgid "Execute the :term:`coroutine` *coro* and return the result."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio "
"event loop, *finalizing asynchronous generators*, and closing the threadpool."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in "
"the same thread."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *debug* is ``True``, the event loop will be run in debug mode. ``False`` "
"disables debug mode explicitly. ``None`` is used to respect the global :ref:"
"`asyncio-debug-mode` settings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end.  It "
"should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should "
"ideally only be called once."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Updated to use :meth:`loop.shutdown_default_executor`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*debug* is ``None`` by default to respect the global debug mode settings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Runner context manager"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A context manager that simplifies *multiple* async function calls in the "
"same context."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes several top-level async functions should be called in the same :"
"ref:`event loop <asyncio-event-loop>` and :class:`contextvars.Context`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*loop_factory* could be used for overriding the loop creation. It is the "
"responsibility of the *loop_factory* to set the created loop as the current "
"one. By default :func:`asyncio.new_event_loop` is used and set as current "
"event loop with :func:`asyncio.set_event_loop` if *loop_factory* is ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Basically, :func:`asyncio.run()` example can be rewritten with the runner "
"usage::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Run a :term:`coroutine <coroutine>` *coro* in the embedded loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the coroutine's result or raise its exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An optional keyword-only *context* argument allows specifying a custom :"
"class:`contextvars.Context` for the *coro* to run in. The runner's default "
"context is used if ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Close the runner."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finalize asynchronous generators, shutdown default executor, close the event "
"loop and release embedded :class:`contextvars.Context`."

":class:`Runner` uses the lazy initialization strategy, its constructor "
"doesn't initialize underlying low-level structures."

"Embedded *loop* and *context* are created at the :keyword:`with` body "

msgid "Handling Keyboard Interruption"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When :const:`signal.SIGINT` is raised by :kbd:`Ctrl-C`, :exc:"
"`KeyboardInterrupt` exception is raised in the main thread by default. "
"However this doesn't work with :mod:`asyncio` because it can interrupt "
"asyncio internals and can hang the program from exiting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To mitigate this issue, :mod:`asyncio` handles :const:`signal.SIGINT` as "
"follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`asyncio.Runner.run` installs a custom :const:`signal.SIGINT` handler "
"before any user code is executed and removes it when exiting from the "
"function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`~asyncio.Runner` creates the main task for the passed coroutine "
"for its execution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When :const:`signal.SIGINT` is raised by :kbd:`Ctrl-C`, the custom signal "
"handler cancels the main task by calling :meth:`asyncio.Task.cancel` which "
"raises :exc:`asyncio.CancelledError` inside the main task.  This causes the "
"Python stack to unwind, ``try/except`` and ``try/finally`` blocks can be "
"used for resource cleanup.  After the main task is cancelled, :meth:`asyncio."
"Runner.run` raises :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A user could write a tight loop which cannot be interrupted by :meth:"
"`asyncio.Task.cancel`, in which case the second following :kbd:`Ctrl-C` "
"immediately raises the :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` without cancelling the main "
"task."
