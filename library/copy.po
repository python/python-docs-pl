msgid ":mod:`copy` --- Shallow and deep copy operations"

msgid ""
"Assignment statements in Python do not copy objects, they create bindings "
"between a target and an object. For collections that are mutable or contain "
"mutable items, a copy is sometimes needed so one can change one copy without "
"changing the other. This module provides generic shallow and deep copy "
"operations (explained below)."

msgid "Interface summary:"

msgid "Return a deep copy of *x*."

msgid "Raised for module specific errors."

msgid ""
"The difference between shallow and deep copying is only relevant for "
"compound objects (objects that contain other objects, like lists or class "
"instances):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A *shallow copy* constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent "
"possible) inserts *references* into it to the objects found in the original."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A *deep copy* constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, "
"inserts *copies* into it of the objects found in the original."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two problems often exist with deep copy operations that don't exist with "
"shallow copy operations:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Recursive objects (compound objects that, directly or indirectly, contain a "
"reference to themselves) may cause a recursive loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because deep copy copies everything it may copy too much, such as data which "
"is intended to be shared between copies."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :func:`deepcopy` function avoids these problems by:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"keeping a ``memo`` dictionary of objects already copied during the current "
"copying pass; and"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"letting user-defined classes override the copying operation or the set of "
"components copied."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module does not copy types like module, method, stack trace, stack "
"frame, file, socket, window, or any similar types.  It does \"copy\" "
"functions and classes (shallow and deeply), by returning the original object "
"unchanged; this is compatible with the way these are treated by the :mod:"
"`pickle` module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Shallow copies of dictionaries can be made using :meth:`dict.copy`, and of "
"lists by assigning a slice of the entire list, for example, ``copied_list = "
"original_list[:]``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Classes can use the same interfaces to control copying that they use to "
"control pickling.  See the description of module :mod:`pickle` for "
"information on these methods.  In fact, the :mod:`copy` module uses the "
"registered pickle functions from the :mod:`copyreg` module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order for a class to define its own copy implementation, it can define "
"special methods :meth:`__copy__` and :meth:`__deepcopy__`.  The former is "
"called to implement the shallow copy operation; no additional arguments are "
"passed. The latter is called to implement the deep copy operation; it is "
"passed one argument, the ``memo`` dictionary.  If the :meth:`__deepcopy__` "
"implementation needs to make a deep copy of a component, it should call the :"
"func:`deepcopy` function with the component as first argument and the memo "
"dictionary as second argument. The memo dictionary should be treated as an "
"opaque object."
