":mod:`multiprocessing.shared_memory` --- Shared memory for direct access "
"across processes"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/multiprocessing/shared_memory.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides a class, :class:`SharedMemory`, for the allocation and "
"management of shared memory to be accessed by one or more processes on a "
"multicore or symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) machine.  To assist with the "
"life-cycle management of shared memory especially across distinct processes, "
"a :class:`~multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager` subclass, :class:"
"`~multiprocessing.managers.SharedMemoryManager`, is also provided in the :"
"mod:`multiprocessing.managers` module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this module, shared memory refers to \"POSIX style\" shared memory blocks "
"(though is not necessarily implemented explicitly as such) and does not "
"refer to \"distributed shared memory\".  This style of shared memory permits "
"distinct processes to potentially read and write to a common (or shared) "
"region of volatile memory.  Processes are conventionally limited to only "
"have access to their own process memory space but shared memory permits the "
"sharing of data between processes, avoiding the need to instead send "
"messages between processes containing that data.  Sharing data directly via "
"memory can provide significant performance benefits compared to sharing data "
"via disk or socket or other communications requiring the serialization/"
"deserialization and copying of data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create an instance of the :class:`!SharedMemory` class for either creating a "
"new shared memory block or attaching to an existing shared memory block.  "
"Each shared memory block is assigned a unique name. In this way, one process "
"can create a shared memory block with a particular name and a different "
"process can attach to that same shared memory block using that same name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a resource for sharing data across processes, shared memory blocks may "
"outlive the original process that created them.  When one process no longer "
"needs access to a shared memory block that might still be needed by other "
"processes, the :meth:`close` method should be called. When a shared memory "
"block is no longer needed by any process, the :meth:`unlink` method should "
"be called to ensure proper cleanup."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parameters"
msgstr "parametry"

msgid ""
"The unique name for the requested shared memory, specified as a string. When "
"creating a new shared memory block, if ``None`` (the default) is supplied "
"for the name, a novel name will be generated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Control whether a new shared memory block is created (``True``) or an "
"existing shared memory block is attached (``False``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The requested number of bytes when creating a new shared memory block. "
"Because some platforms choose to allocate chunks of memory based upon that "
"platform's memory page size, the exact size of the shared memory block may "
"be larger or equal to the size requested. When attaching to an existing "
"shared memory block, the *size* parameter is ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Close access to the shared memory from this instance.  In order to ensure "
"proper cleanup of resources, all instances should call :meth:`close` once "
"the instance is no longer needed.  Note that calling :meth:`!close` does not "
"cause the shared memory block itself to be destroyed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Request that the underlying shared memory block be destroyed.  In order to "
"ensure proper cleanup of resources, :meth:`unlink` should be called once "
"(and only once) across all processes which have need for the shared memory "
"block.  After requesting its destruction, a shared memory block may or may "
"not be immediately destroyed and this behavior may differ across platforms.  "
"Attempts to access data inside the shared memory block after :meth:`!unlink` "
"has been called may result in memory access errors.  Note: the last process "
"relinquishing its hold on a shared memory block may call :meth:`!unlink` "
"and :meth:`close` in either order."

"A subclass of :class:`multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager` which can be "
"used for the management of shared memory blocks across processes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A call to :meth:`~multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager.start` on a :class:`!"
"SharedMemoryManager` instance causes a new process to be started. This new "
"process's sole purpose is to manage the life cycle of all shared memory "
"blocks created through it.  To trigger the release of all shared memory "
"blocks managed by that process, call :meth:`~multiprocessing.managers."
"BaseManager.shutdown` on the instance. This triggers a :meth:"
"`~multiprocessing.shared_memory.SharedMemory.unlink` call on all of the :"
"class:`SharedMemory` objects managed by that process and then stops the "
"process itself.  By creating :class:`!SharedMemory` instances through a :"
"class:`!SharedMemoryManager`, we avoid the need to manually track and "
"trigger the freeing of shared memory resources."

"*name* is the unique name for the requested shared memory, as described in "
