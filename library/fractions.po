"The first version requires that *numerator* and *denominator* are instances "
"of :class:`numbers.Rational` and returns a new :class:`Fraction` instance "
"with value ``numerator/denominator``. If *denominator* is :const:`0`, it "
"raises a :exc:`ZeroDivisionError`. The second version requires that "
"*other_fraction* is an instance of :class:`numbers.Rational` and returns a :"
"class:`Fraction` instance with the same value.  The next two versions accept "
"either a :class:`float` or a :class:`decimal.Decimal` instance, and return "
"a :class:`Fraction` instance with exactly the same value.  Note that due to "
"the usual issues with binary floating-point (see :ref:`tut-fp-issues`), the "
"argument to ``Fraction(1.1)`` is not exactly equal to 11/10, and so "
"``Fraction(1.1)`` does *not* return ``Fraction(11, 10)`` as one might "
"expect. (But see the documentation for the :meth:`limit_denominator` method "
"below.) The last version of the constructor expects a string or unicode "
"instance. The usual form for this instance is::"

msgid ""
"where the optional ``sign`` may be either '+' or '-' and ``numerator`` and "
"``denominator`` (if present) are strings of decimal digits (underscores may "
"be used to delimit digits as with integral literals in code).  In addition, "
"any string that represents a finite value and is accepted by the :class:"
"`float` constructor is also accepted by the :class:`Fraction` constructor.  "
"In either form the input string may also have leading and/or trailing "
"whitespace. Here are some examples::"

"The :class:`Fraction` class inherits from the abstract base class :class:"
"`numbers.Rational`, and implements all of the methods and operations from "
"that class.  :class:`Fraction` instances are :term:`hashable`, and should be "
"treated as immutable.  In addition, :class:`Fraction` has the following "
"properties and methods:"

"The :func:`math.gcd` function is now used to normalize the *numerator* and "
"*denominator*. :func:`math.gcd` always return a :class:`int` type. "
