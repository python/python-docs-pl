msgid ":mod:`bz2` --- Support for :program:`bzip2` compression"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/bz2.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides a comprehensive interface for compressing and "
"decompressing data using the bzip2 compression algorithm."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`bz2` module contains:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`.open` function and :class:`BZ2File` class for reading and "
"writing compressed files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`BZ2Compressor` and :class:`BZ2Decompressor` classes for "
"incremental (de)compression."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`compress` and :func:`decompress` functions for one-shot "
"(de)compression."
msgstr ""

msgid "(De)compression of files"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open a bzip2-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a :term:`file "
"object`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As with the constructor for :class:`BZ2File`, the *filename* argument can be "
"an actual filename (a :class:`str` or :class:`bytes` object), or an existing "
"file object to read from or write to."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *mode* argument can be any of ``'r'``, ``'rb'``, ``'w'``, ``'wb'``, "
"``'x'``, ``'xb'``, ``'a'`` or ``'ab'`` for binary mode, or ``'rt'``, "
"``'wt'``, ``'xt'``, or ``'at'`` for text mode. The default is ``'rb'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *compresslevel* argument is an integer from 1 to 9, as for the :class:"
"`BZ2File` constructor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the :class:`BZ2File` "
"constructor: ``BZ2File(filename, mode, compresslevel=compresslevel)``. In "
"this case, the *encoding*, *errors* and *newline* arguments must not be "
"provided."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For text mode, a :class:`BZ2File` object is created, and wrapped in an :"
"class:`io.TextIOWrapper` instance with the specified encoding, error "
"handling behavior, and line ending(s)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``'x'`` (exclusive creation) mode was added."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accepts a :term:`path-like object`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Open a bzip2-compressed file in binary mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *filename* is a :class:`str` or :class:`bytes` object, open the named "
"file directly. Otherwise, *filename* should be a :term:`file object`, which "
"will be used to read or write the compressed data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *mode* argument can be either ``'r'`` for reading (default), ``'w'`` for "
"overwriting, ``'x'`` for exclusive creation, or ``'a'`` for appending. These "
"can equivalently be given as ``'rb'``, ``'wb'``, ``'xb'`` and ``'ab'`` "
"respectively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *filename* is a file object (rather than an actual file name), a mode of "
"``'w'`` does not truncate the file, and is instead equivalent to ``'a'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *mode* is ``'w'`` or ``'a'``, *compresslevel* can be an integer between "
"``1`` and ``9`` specifying the level of compression: ``1`` produces the "
"least compression, and ``9`` (default) produces the most compression."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *mode* is ``'r'``, the input file may be the concatenation of multiple "
"compressed streams."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`BZ2File` provides all of the members specified by the :class:`io."
"BufferedIOBase`, except for :meth:`detach` and :meth:`truncate`. Iteration "
"and the :keyword:`with` statement are supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`BZ2File` also provides the following method:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return buffered data without advancing the file position. At least one byte "
"of data will be returned (unless at EOF). The exact number of bytes returned "
"is unspecified."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While calling :meth:`peek` does not change the file position of the :class:"
"`BZ2File`, it may change the position of the underlying file object (e.g. if "
"the :class:`BZ2File` was constructed by passing a file object for "
"*filename*)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Support for the :keyword:`with` statement was added."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :meth:`fileno`, :meth:`readable`, :meth:`seekable`, :meth:`writable`, :"
"meth:`read1` and :meth:`readinto` methods were added."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support was added for *filename* being a :term:`file object` instead of an "
"actual filename."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``'a'`` (append) mode was added, along with support for reading multi-"
"stream files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :meth:`~io.BufferedIOBase.read` method now accepts an argument of "
"``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *buffering* parameter has been removed. It was ignored and deprecated "
"since Python 3.0. Pass an open file object to control how the file is opened."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *compresslevel* parameter became keyword-only."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This class is thread unsafe in the face of multiple simultaneous readers or "
"writers, just like its equivalent classes in :mod:`gzip` and :mod:`lzma` "
"have always been."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The compressor object may not be used after this method has been called."

msgid ""
"Create a new decompressor object. This object may be used to decompress data "
"incrementally. For one-shot compression, use the :func:`decompress` function "
"instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This class does not transparently handle inputs containing multiple "
"compressed streams, unlike :func:`decompress` and :class:`BZ2File`. If you "
"need to decompress a multi-stream input with :class:`BZ2Decompressor`, you "
"must use a new decompressor for each stream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Decompress *data* (a :term:`bytes-like object`), returning uncompressed data "
"as bytes. Some of *data* may be buffered internally, for use in later calls "

"output of any previous calls to :meth:`decompress`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *max_length* is nonnegative, returns at most *max_length* bytes of "
"decompressed data. If this limit is reached and further output can be "
"produced, the :attr:`~.needs_input` attribute will be set to ``False``. In "
"this case, the next call to :meth:`~.decompress` may provide *data* as "
"``b''`` to obtain more of the output."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If all of the input data was decompressed and returned (either because this "
"was less than *max_length* bytes, or because *max_length* was negative), "
"the :attr:`~.needs_input` attribute will be set to ``True``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Attempting to decompress data after the end of stream is reached raises an :"
"exc:`EOFError`.  Any data found after the end of the stream is ignored and "
"saved in the :attr:`~.unused_data` attribute."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *max_length* parameter."

"The example above uses a very \"nonrandom\" stream of data (a stream of "
