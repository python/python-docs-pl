msgid ":mod:`uu` --- Encode and decode uuencode files"

msgid ""
"The :mod:`uu` module is deprecated (see :pep:`PEP 594 <594#uu-and-the-uu-"
"encoding>` for details). :mod:`base64` is a modern alternative."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module encodes and decodes files in uuencode format, allowing arbitrary "
"binary data to be transferred over ASCII-only connections. Wherever a file "
"argument is expected, the methods accept a file-like object.  For backwards "
"compatibility, a string containing a pathname is also accepted, and the "
"corresponding file will be opened for reading and writing; the pathname "
"``'-'`` is understood to mean the standard input or output.  However, this "
"interface is deprecated; it's better for the caller to open the file itself, "
"and be sure that, when required, the mode is ``'rb'`` or ``'wb'`` on Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This code was contributed by Lance Ellinghouse, and modified by Jack Jansen."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`uu` module defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Uuencode file *in_file* into file *out_file*.  The uuencoded file will have "
"the header specifying *name* and *mode* as the defaults for the results of "
"decoding the file. The default defaults are taken from *in_file*, or ``'-'`` "
"and ``0o666`` respectively.  If *backtick* is true, zeros are represented by "
"``'`'`` instead of spaces."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *backtick* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This call decodes uuencoded file *in_file* placing the result on file "
"*out_file*. If *out_file* is a pathname, *mode* is used to set the "
"permission bits if the file must be created. Defaults for *out_file* and "
"*mode* are taken from the uuencode header.  However, if the file specified "
"in the header already exists, a :exc:`uu.Error` is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`decode` may print a warning to standard error if the input was "
"produced by an incorrect uuencoder and Python could recover from that "
"error.  Setting *quiet* to a true value silences this warning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subclass of :exc:`Exception`, this can be raised by :func:`uu.decode` under "
"various situations, such as described above, but also including a badly "
"formatted header, or truncated input file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Module :mod:`binascii`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support module containing ASCII-to-binary and binary-to-ASCII conversions."
msgstr ""
"Wspierający moduł zawierający konwersję ASCII-do-binarnego i binarnego-do-"
"ASCII."
