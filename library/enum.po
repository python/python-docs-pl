msgid "Having two enum members with the same name is invalid::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, two enum members are allowed to have the same value.  Given two "
"members A and B with the same value (and A defined first), B is an alias to "

"The values are chosen by :func:`_generate_next_value_`, which can be "
"overridden::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The goal of the default :meth:`_generate_next_value_` method is to provide "
"the next :class:`int` in sequence with the last :class:`int` provided, but "
"the way it does this is an implementation detail and may change."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :meth:`_generate_next_value_` method must be defined before any members."
msgstr ""

msgid "Iteration"
msgstr ""

msgid "Iterating over the members of an enum does not provide the aliases::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The special attribute ``__members__`` is a read-only ordered mapping of "
"names to members.  It includes all names defined in the enumeration, "
"including the aliases::"

"The ``__members__`` attribute can be used for detailed programmatic access "
"to the enumeration members.  For example, finding all the aliases::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Comparisons"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enumeration members are compared by identity::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ordered comparisons between enumeration values are *not* supported.  Enum "
"members are not integers (but see `IntEnum`_ below)::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Equality comparisons are defined though::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Comparisons against non-enumeration values will always compare not equal "
"(again, :class:`IntEnum` was explicitly designed to behave differently, see "
"below)::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Allowed members and attributes of enumerations"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The examples above use integers for enumeration values.  Using integers is "
"short and handy (and provided by default by the `Functional API`_), but not "
"strictly enforced.  In the vast majority of use-cases, one doesn't care what "
"the actual value of an enumeration is.  But if the value *is* important, "
"enumerations can have arbitrary values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enumerations are Python classes, and can have methods and special methods as "
"usual.  If we have this enumeration::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Then::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The rules for what is allowed are as follows: names that start and end with "
"a single underscore are reserved by enum and cannot be used; all other "
"attributes defined within an enumeration will become members of this "
"enumeration, with the exception of special methods (:meth:`__str__`, :meth:"
"`__add__`, etc.), descriptors (methods are also descriptors), and variable "
"names listed in :attr:`_ignore_`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note:  if your enumeration defines :meth:`__new__` and/or :meth:`__init__` "
"then any value(s) given to the enum member will be passed into those "
"methods. See `Planet`_ for an example."
msgstr ""

msgid "Restricted Enum subclassing"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A new :class:`Enum` class must have one base Enum class, up to one concrete "
"data type, and as many :class:`object`-based mixin classes as needed.  The "
"order of these base classes is::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, subclassing an enumeration is allowed only if the enumeration does not "
"define any members.  So this is forbidden::"
msgstr ""

msgid "But this is allowed::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Allowing subclassing of enums that define members would lead to a violation "
"of some important invariants of types and instances.  On the other hand, it "
"makes sense to allow sharing some common behavior between a group of "
"enumerations. (See `OrderedEnum`_ for an example.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Pickling"
msgstr ""

msgid "Enumerations can be pickled and unpickled::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The usual restrictions for pickling apply: picklable enums must be defined "
"in the top level of a module, since unpickling requires them to be "
"importable from that module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With pickle protocol version 4 it is possible to easily pickle enums nested "
"in other classes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to modify how Enum members are pickled/unpickled by defining :"
"meth:`__reduce_ex__` in the enumeration class."
msgstr ""

msgid "Functional API"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`Enum` class is callable, providing the following functional API::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The semantics of this API resemble :class:`~collections.namedtuple`. The "
"first argument of the call to :class:`Enum` is the name of the enumeration."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second argument is the *source* of enumeration member names.  It can be "
"a whitespace-separated string of names, a sequence of names, a sequence of 2-"
"tuples with key/value pairs, or a mapping (e.g. dictionary) of names to "
"values.  The last two options enable assigning arbitrary values to "
"enumerations; the others auto-assign increasing integers starting with 1 "
"(use the ``start`` parameter to specify a different starting value).  A new "
"class derived from :class:`Enum` is returned.  In other words, the above "
"assignment to :class:`Animal` is equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The reason for defaulting to ``1`` as the starting number and not ``0`` is "
"that ``0`` is ``False`` in a boolean sense, but enum members all evaluate to "
"``True``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pickling enums created with the functional API can be tricky as frame stack "
"implementation details are used to try and figure out which module the "
"enumeration is being created in (e.g. it will fail if you use a utility "
"function in separate module, and also may not work on IronPython or Jython). "
"The solution is to specify the module name explicitly as follows::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``module`` is not supplied, and Enum cannot determine what it is, the new "
"Enum members will not be unpicklable; to keep errors closer to the source, "
"pickling will be disabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The new pickle protocol 4 also, in some circumstances, relies on :attr:"
"`~definition.__qualname__` being set to the location where pickle will be "
"able to find the class.  For example, if the class was made available in "
"class SomeData in the global scope::"

msgid "Derived Enumerations"
msgstr ""

msgid "IntEnum"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The first variation of :class:`Enum` that is provided is also a subclass of :"
"class:`int`.  Members of an :class:`IntEnum` can be compared to integers; by "
"extension, integer enumerations of different types can also be compared to "
"each other::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, they still can't be compared to standard :class:`Enum` "
"enumerations::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`IntEnum` values behave like integers in other ways you'd expect::"
msgstr ""

msgid "IntFlag"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The next variation of :class:`Enum` provided, :class:`IntFlag`, is also "
"based on :class:`int`.  The difference being :class:`IntFlag` members can be "
"combined using the bitwise operators (&, \\|, ^, ~) and the result is still "
"an :class:`IntFlag` member.  However, as the name implies, :class:`IntFlag` "
"members also subclass :class:`int` and can be used wherever an :class:`int` "
"is used.  Any operation on an :class:`IntFlag` member besides the bit-wise "
"operations will lose the :class:`IntFlag` membership."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sample :class:`IntFlag` class::"
msgstr ""

msgid "It is also possible to name the combinations::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Another important difference between :class:`IntFlag` and :class:`Enum` is "
"that if no flags are set (the value is 0), its boolean evaluation is :data:"
"`False`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because :class:`IntFlag` members are also subclasses of :class:`int` they "
"can be combined with them::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Flag"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The last variation is :class:`Flag`.  Like :class:`IntFlag`, :class:`Flag` "
"members can be combined using the bitwise operators (&, \\|, ^, ~).  Unlike :"
"class:`IntFlag`, they cannot be combined with, nor compared against, any "
"other :class:`Flag` enumeration, nor :class:`int`.  While it is possible to "
"specify the values directly it is recommended to use :class:`auto` as the "
"value and let :class:`Flag` select an appropriate value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like :class:`IntFlag`, if a combination of :class:`Flag` members results in "
"no flags being set, the boolean evaluation is :data:`False`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Individual flags should have values that are powers of two (1, 2, 4, "
"8, ...), while combinations of flags won't::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Giving a name to the \"no flags set\" condition does not change its boolean "
"value::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the majority of new code, :class:`Enum` and :class:`Flag` are strongly "
"recommended, since :class:`IntEnum` and :class:`IntFlag` break some semantic "
"promises of an enumeration (by being comparable to integers, and thus by "
"transitivity to other unrelated enumerations).  :class:`IntEnum` and :class:"
"`IntFlag` should be used only in cases where :class:`Enum` and :class:`Flag` "
"will not do; for example, when integer constants are replaced with "
"enumerations, or for interoperability with other systems."
msgstr ""

msgid "Others"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While :class:`IntEnum` is part of the :mod:`enum` module, it would be very "
"simple to implement independently::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This demonstrates how similar derived enumerations can be defined; for "
"example a :class:`StrEnum` that mixes in :class:`str` instead of :class:"
"`int`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some rules:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When subclassing :class:`Enum`, mix-in types must appear before :class:"
"`Enum` itself in the sequence of bases, as in the :class:`IntEnum` example "
"above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While :class:`Enum` can have members of any type, once you mix in an "
"additional type, all the members must have values of that type, e.g. :class:"
"`int` above.  This restriction does not apply to mix-ins which only add "
"methods and don't specify another type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When another data type is mixed in, the :attr:`value` attribute is *not the "
"same* as the enum member itself, although it is equivalent and will compare "
"equal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"%-style formatting:  `%s` and `%r` call the :class:`Enum` class's :meth:"
"`__str__` and :meth:`__repr__` respectively; other codes (such as `%i` or "
"`%h` for IntEnum) treat the enum member as its mixed-in type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":ref:`Formatted string literals <f-strings>`, :meth:`str.format`, and :func:"
"`format` will use the mixed-in type's :meth:`__format__` unless :meth:"
"`__str__` or :meth:`__format__` is overridden in the subclass, in which case "
"the overridden methods or :class:`Enum` methods will be used. Use the !s "
"and !r format codes to force usage of the :class:`Enum` class's :meth:"
"`__str__` and :meth:`__repr__` methods."
msgstr ""

msgid "When to use :meth:`__new__` vs. :meth:`__init__`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`__new__` must be used whenever you want to customize the actual value "
"of the :class:`Enum` member.  Any other modifications may go in either :meth:"
"`__new__` or :meth:`__init__`, with :meth:`__init__` being preferred."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For example, if you want to pass several items to the constructor, but only "
"want one of them to be the value::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Interesting examples"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While :class:`Enum`, :class:`IntEnum`, :class:`IntFlag`, and :class:`Flag` "
"are expected to cover the majority of use-cases, they cannot cover them "
"all.  Here are recipes for some different types of enumerations that can be "
"used directly, or as examples for creating one's own."
msgstr ""

msgid "Omitting values"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In many use-cases one doesn't care what the actual value of an enumeration "
"is. There are several ways to define this type of simple enumeration:"

msgstr ""

msgid "use instances of :class:`object` as the value"

msgid "use a descriptive string as the value"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"use a tuple as the value and a custom :meth:`__new__` to replace the tuple "
"with an :class:`int` value"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using any of these methods signifies to the user that these values are not "
"important, and also enables one to add, remove, or reorder members without "
"having to renumber the remaining members."

msgid ""
"The :meth:`__new__` method, if defined, is used during creation of the Enum "
