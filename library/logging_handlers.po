"The following useful handlers are provided in the package. Note that three "
"of the handlers (:class:`StreamHandler`, :class:`FileHandler` and :class:"
"`NullHandler`) are actually defined in the :mod:`logging` module itself, but "
"have been documented here along with the other handlers."
msgstr ""

msgid "StreamHandler"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`StreamHandler` class, located in the core :mod:`logging` "
"package, sends logging output to streams such as *sys.stdout*, *sys.stderr* "
"or any file-like object (or, more precisely, any object which supports :meth:"
"`write` and :meth:`flush` methods)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a new instance of the :class:`StreamHandler` class. If *stream* is "
"specified, the instance will use it for logging output; otherwise, *sys."
"stderr* will be used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a formatter is specified, it is used to format the record. The record is "
"then written to the stream followed by :attr:`terminator`. If exception "
"information is present, it is formatted using :func:`traceback."
"print_exception` and appended to the stream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Flushes the stream by calling its :meth:`flush` method. Note that the :meth:"
"`close` method is inherited from :class:`~logging.Handler` and so does no "
"output, so an explicit :meth:`flush` call may be needed at times."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sets the instance's stream to the specified value, if it is different. The "
"old stream is flushed before the new stream is set."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parameters"
msgstr ""

msgid "The stream that the handler should use."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns"
msgstr ""

msgid "the old stream, if the stream was changed, or *None* if it wasn't."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"String used as the terminator when writing a formatted record to a stream. "
"Default value is ``'\\n'``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you don't want a newline termination, you can set the handler instance's "
"``terminator`` attribute to the empty string."
msgstr ""

msgid "In earlier versions, the terminator was hardcoded as ``'\\n'``."
msgstr ""

msgid "FileHandler"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`FileHandler` class, located in the core :mod:`logging` package, "
"sends logging output to a disk file.  It inherits the output functionality "
"from :class:`StreamHandler`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a new instance of the :class:`FileHandler` class. The specified file "
"is opened and used as the stream for logging. If *mode* is not specified, :"
"const:`'a'` is used.  If *encoding* is not ``None``, it is used to open the "
"file with that encoding.  If *delay* is true, then file opening is deferred "
"until the first call to :meth:`emit`. By default, the file grows "
"indefinitely. If *errors* is specified, it's used to determine how encoding "
"errors are handled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As well as string values, :class:`~pathlib.Path` objects are also accepted "
"for the *filename* argument."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *errors* parameter was added."
msgstr ""

msgid "Closes the file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Outputs the record to the file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that if the file was closed due to logging shutdown at exit and the "
"file mode is 'w', the record will not be emitted (see :issue:`42378`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "NullHandler"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`NullHandler` class, located in the core :mod:`logging` package, "
"does not do any formatting or output. It is essentially a 'no-op' handler "
"for use by library developers."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns a new instance of the :class:`NullHandler` class."
msgstr ""

msgid "This method does nothing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method returns ``None`` for the lock, since there is no underlying I/O "
"to which access needs to be serialized."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See :ref:`library-config` for more information on how to use :class:"
"`NullHandler`."
msgstr ""

msgid "WatchedFileHandler"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`WatchedFileHandler` class, located in the :mod:`logging."
"handlers` module, is a :class:`FileHandler` which watches the file it is "
"logging to. If the file changes, it is closed and reopened using the file "
"name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A file change can happen because of usage of programs such as *newsyslog* "
"and *logrotate* which perform log file rotation. This handler, intended for "
"use under Unix/Linux, watches the file to see if it has changed since the "
"last emit. (A file is deemed to have changed if its device or inode have "
"changed.) If the file has changed, the old file stream is closed, and the "
"file opened to get a new stream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This handler is not appropriate for use under Windows, because under Windows "
"open log files cannot be moved or renamed - logging opens the files with "
"exclusive locks - and so there is no need for such a handler. Furthermore, "
"*ST_INO* is not supported under Windows; :func:`~os.stat` always returns "
"zero for this value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a new instance of the :class:`WatchedFileHandler` class. The "
"specified file is opened and used as the stream for logging. If *mode* is "
"not specified, :const:`'a'` is used.  If *encoding* is not ``None``, it is "
"used to open the file with that encoding.  If *delay* is true, then file "
"opening is deferred until the first call to :meth:`emit`.  By default, the "
"file grows indefinitely. If *errors* is provided, it determines how encoding "
"errors are handled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Checks to see if the file has changed.  If it has, the existing stream is "
"flushed and closed and the file opened again, typically as a precursor to "
"outputting the record to the file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Outputs the record to the file, but first calls :meth:`reopenIfNeeded` to "
"reopen the file if it has changed."
msgstr ""

msgid "BaseRotatingHandler"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`BaseRotatingHandler` class, located in the :mod:`logging."
"handlers` module, is the base class for the rotating file handlers, :class:"
"`RotatingFileHandler` and :class:`TimedRotatingFileHandler`. You should not "
"need to instantiate this class, but it has attributes and methods you may "
"need to override."
msgstr ""

msgid "The parameters are as for :class:`FileHandler`. The attributes are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this attribute is set to a callable, the :meth:`rotation_filename` method "
"delegates to this callable. The parameters passed to the callable are those "
"passed to :meth:`rotation_filename`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The namer function is called quite a few times during rollover, so it should "
"be as simple and as fast as possible. It should also return the same output "
"every time for a given input, otherwise the rollover behaviour may not work "
"as expected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's also worth noting that care should be taken when using a namer to "
"preserve certain attributes in the filename which are used during rotation. "
"For example, :class:`RotatingFileHandler` expects to have a set of log files "
"whose names contain successive integers, so that rotation works as expected, "
"and :class:`TimedRotatingFileHandler` deletes old log files (based on the "
"``backupCount`` parameter passed to the handler's initializer) by "
"determining the oldest files to delete. For this to happen, the filenames "
"should be sortable using the date/time portion of the filename, and a namer "
"needs to respect this. (If a namer is wanted that doesn't respect this "
"scheme, it will need to be used in a subclass of :class:"
"`TimedRotatingFileHandler` which overrides the :meth:"
"`~TimedRotatingFileHandler.getFilesToDelete` method to fit in with the "
"custom naming scheme.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this attribute is set to a callable, the :meth:`rotate` method delegates "
"to this callable.  The parameters passed to the callable are those passed "
"to :meth:`rotate`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Modify the filename of a log file when rotating."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is provided so that a custom filename can be provided."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default implementation calls the 'namer' attribute of the handler, if "
"it's callable, passing the default name to it. If the attribute isn't "
"callable (the default is ``None``), the name is returned unchanged."
msgstr ""

msgid "The default name for the log file."
msgstr ""

msgid "When rotating, rotate the current log."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default implementation calls the 'rotator' attribute of the handler, if "
"it's callable, passing the source and dest arguments to it. If the attribute "
"isn't callable (the default is ``None``), the source is simply renamed to "
"the destination."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The source filename. This is normally the base filename, e.g. 'test.log'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The destination filename. This is normally what the source is rotated to, e."
"g. 'test.log.1'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The reason the attributes exist is to save you having to subclass - you can "
"use the same callables for instances of :class:`RotatingFileHandler` and :"
"class:`TimedRotatingFileHandler`. If either the namer or rotator callable "
"raises an exception, this will be handled in the same way as any other "
"exception during an :meth:`emit` call, i.e. via the :meth:`handleError` "
"method of the handler."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to make more significant changes to rotation processing, you can "
"override the methods."
msgstr ""

msgid "For an example, see :ref:`cookbook-rotator-namer`."

msgid "RotatingFileHandler"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`RotatingFileHandler` class, located in the :mod:`logging."

"errors are handled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use the *maxBytes* and *backupCount* values to allow the file to :"
"dfn:`rollover` at a predetermined size. When the size is about to be "
"exceeded, the file is closed and a new file is silently opened for output. "
"Rollover occurs whenever the current log file is nearly *maxBytes* in "
"length; but if either of *maxBytes* or *backupCount* is zero, rollover never "
"occurs, so you generally want to set *backupCount* to at least 1, and have a "
"non-zero *maxBytes*. When *backupCount* is non-zero, the system will save "
"old log files by appending the extensions '.1', '.2' etc., to the filename. "
"For example, with a *backupCount* of 5 and a base file name of :file:`app."
"log`, you would get :file:`app.log`, :file:`app.log.1`, :file:`app.log.2`, "
"up to :file:`app.log.5`. The file being written to is always :file:`app."
"log`.  When this file is filled, it is closed and renamed to :file:`app."
"log.1`, and if files :file:`app.log.1`, :file:`app.log.2`, etc. exist, then "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a new instance of the :class:`TimedRotatingFileHandler` class. The "

msgid ""
"The system will save old log files by appending extensions to the filename. "

"%d_%H-%M-%S`` or a leading portion thereof, depending on the rollover "
"interval."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When computing the next rollover time for the first time (when the handler "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the *utc* argument is true, times in UTC will be used; otherwise local "
"time is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *backupCount* is nonzero, at most *backupCount* files will be kept, and "
"if more would be created when rollover occurs, the oldest one is deleted. "
"The deletion logic uses the interval to determine which files to delete, so "

"Calculation of the initial rollover time is done when the handler is "

"interval of \"every minute\" is set, that does not mean you will always see "
"log files with times (in the filename) separated by a minute; if, during "
"application execution, logging output is generated more frequently than once "
"a minute, *then* you can expect to see log files with times separated by a "
"minute. If, on the other hand, logging messages are only output once every "
"five minutes (say), then there will be gaps in the file times corresponding "
"to the minutes where no output (and hence no rollover) occurred."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tries to create a socket; on failure, uses an exponential back-off "
"algorithm.  On initial failure, the handler will drop the message it was "
"trying to send.  When subsequent messages are handled by the same instance, "
"it will not try connecting until some time has passed.  The default "
"parameters are such that the initial delay is one second, and if after that "
"delay the connection still can't be made, the handler will double the delay "
"each time up to a maximum of 30 seconds."

msgid "``retryFactor`` (multiplier, defaulting to 2.0)."
msgstr ""

msgid "``retryMax`` (maximum delay, defaulting to 30.0 seconds)."

msgid ""
"As UDP is not a streaming protocol, there is no persistent connection "
