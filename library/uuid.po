"This module provides immutable :class:`UUID` objects (the :class:`UUID` "
"class) and the functions :func:`uuid1`, :func:`uuid3`, :func:`uuid4`, :func:"

"`4122`."

msgid ""
"If all you want is a unique ID, you should probably call :func:`uuid1` or :"
"func:`uuid4`.  Note that :func:`uuid1` may compromise privacy since it "
"creates a UUID containing the computer's network address.  :func:`uuid4` "
"creates a random UUID."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Depending on support from the underlying platform, :func:`uuid1` may or may "
"not return a \"safe\" UUID.  A safe UUID is one which is generated using "
"synchronization methods that ensure no two processes can obtain the same "
"UUID.  All instances of :class:`UUID` have an :attr:`is_safe` attribute "
"which relays any information about the UUID's safety, using this enumeration:"
