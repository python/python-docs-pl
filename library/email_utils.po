"the system time zone database.  If *dt* is naive (that is, ``dt.tzinfo`` is "

"zero value for *isdst* causes ``localtime`` to presume initially that summer "
"time (for example, Daylight Saving Time) is or is not (respectively) in "
"effect for the specified time.  A negative value for *isdst* causes the "
