"This section outlines high-level asyncio APIs to work with coroutines and "
"Tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Coroutines"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/asyncio/coroutines.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":term:`Coroutines <coroutine>` declared with the async/await syntax is the "
"preferred way of writing asyncio applications.  For example, the following "
"snippet of code prints \"hello\", waits 1 second, and then prints \"world\"::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that simply calling a coroutine will not schedule it to be executed::"
msgstr ""

msgid "To actually run a coroutine, asyncio provides three main mechanisms:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`asyncio.run` function to run the top-level entry point \"main()\" "
"function (see the above example.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Awaiting on a coroutine.  The following snippet of code will print \"hello\" "
"after waiting for 1 second, and then print \"world\" after waiting for "
"*another* 2 seconds::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Expected output::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`asyncio.create_task` function to run coroutines concurrently as "
"asyncio :class:`Tasks <Task>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Let's modify the above example and run two ``say_after`` coroutines "
"*concurrently*::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that expected output now shows that the snippet runs 1 second faster "
"than before::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Awaitables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We say that an object is an **awaitable** object if it can be used in an :"
"keyword:`await` expression.  Many asyncio APIs are designed to accept "
"awaitables."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are three main types of *awaitable* objects: **coroutines**, "
"**Tasks**, and **Futures**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python coroutines are *awaitables* and therefore can be awaited from other "
"coroutines::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In this documentation the term \"coroutine\" can be used for two closely "
"related concepts:"
msgstr ""

msgid "a *coroutine function*: an :keyword:`async def` function;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"a *coroutine object*: an object returned by calling a *coroutine function*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"asyncio also supports legacy :ref:`generator-based "
"<asyncio_generator_based_coro>` coroutines."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid "*Tasks* are used to schedule coroutines *concurrently*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a coroutine is wrapped into a *Task* with functions like :func:`asyncio."
"create_task` the coroutine is automatically scheduled to run soon::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Futures"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :class:`Future` is a special **low-level** awaitable object that "
"represents an **eventual result** of an asynchronous operation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a Future object is *awaited* it means that the coroutine will wait "
"until the Future is resolved in some other place."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Future objects in asyncio are needed to allow callback-based code to be used "
"with async/await."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally **there is no need** to create Future objects at the application "
"level code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Future objects, sometimes exposed by libraries and some asyncio APIs, can be "
"awaited::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A good example of a low-level function that returns a Future object is :meth:"
"`loop.run_in_executor`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running an asyncio Program"
msgstr ""

msgid "Execute the :term:`coroutine` *coro* and return the result."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function runs the passed coroutine, taking care of managing the asyncio "
"event loop, *finalizing asynchronous generators*, and closing the threadpool."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function cannot be called when another asyncio event loop is running in "
"the same thread."
msgstr ""

msgid "If *debug* is ``True``, the event loop will be run in debug mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function always creates a new event loop and closes it at the end.  It "
"should be used as a main entry point for asyncio programs, and should "
"ideally only be called once."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Updated to use :meth:`loop.shutdown_default_executor`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The source code for ``asyncio.run()`` can be found in :source:`Lib/asyncio/"
"runners.py`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Creating Tasks"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/asyncio/tasks.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Wrap the *coro* :ref:`coroutine <coroutine>` into a :class:`Task` and "
"schedule its execution.  Return the Task object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *name* is not ``None``, it is set as the name of the task using :meth:"
"`Task.set_name`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The task is executed in the loop returned by :func:`get_running_loop`, :exc:"
"`RuntimeError` is raised if there is no running loop in current thread."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Save a reference to the result of this function, to avoid a task "
"disappearing mid-execution. The event loop only keeps weak references to "
"tasks. A task that isn't referenced elsewhere may get garbage collected at "
"any time, even before it's done. For reliable \"fire-and-forget\" background "
"tasks, gather them in a collection::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *name* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Sleeping"
msgstr ""

msgid "Block for *delay* seconds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *result* is provided, it is returned to the caller when the coroutine "
"completes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``sleep()`` always suspends the current task, allowing other tasks to run."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting the delay to 0 provides an optimized path to allow other tasks to "
"run. This can be used by long-running functions to avoid blocking the event "
"loop for the full duration of the function call."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``loop`` parameter.  This function has been implicitly getting the "
"current running loop since 3.7.  See :ref:`What's New in 3.10's Removed "
"section <whatsnew310-removed>` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Example of coroutine displaying the current date every second for 5 seconds::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Removed the *loop* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running Tasks Concurrently"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Run :ref:`awaitable objects <asyncio-awaitables>` in the *aws* sequence "
"*concurrently*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If any awaitable in *aws* is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a "
"Task."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If all awaitables are completed successfully, the result is an aggregate "
"list of returned values.  The order of result values corresponds to the "
"order of awaitables in *aws*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *return_exceptions* is ``False`` (default), the first raised exception is "
"immediately propagated to the task that awaits on ``gather()``.  Other "
"awaitables in the *aws* sequence **won't be cancelled** and will continue to "
"run."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *return_exceptions* is ``True``, exceptions are treated the same as "
"successful results, and aggregated in the result list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``gather()`` is *cancelled*, all submitted awaitables (that have not "
"completed yet) are also *cancelled*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If any Task or Future from the *aws* sequence is *cancelled*, it is treated "
"as if it raised :exc:`CancelledError` -- the ``gather()`` call is **not** "
"cancelled in this case.  This is to prevent the cancellation of one "
"submitted Task/Future to cause other Tasks/Futures to be cancelled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *return_exceptions* is False, cancelling gather() after it has been "
"marked done won't cancel any submitted awaitables. For instance, gather can "
"be marked done after propagating an exception to the caller, therefore, "
"calling ``gather.cancel()`` after catching an exception (raised by one of "
"the awaitables) from gather won't cancel any other awaitables."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the *gather* itself is cancelled, the cancellation is propagated "
"regardless of *return_exceptions*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Deprecation warning is emitted if no positional arguments are provided or "
"not all positional arguments are Future-like objects and there is no running "
"event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shielding From Cancellation"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Protect an :ref:`awaitable object <asyncio-awaitables>` from being :meth:"
"`cancelled <Task.cancel>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "If *aw* is a coroutine it is automatically scheduled as a Task."
msgstr ""

msgid "The statement::"
msgstr ""

msgid "is equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*except* that if the coroutine containing it is cancelled, the Task running "
"in ``something()`` is not cancelled.  From the point of view of "
"``something()``, the cancellation did not happen. Although its caller is "
"still cancelled, so the \"await\" expression still raises a :exc:"
"`CancelledError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``something()`` is cancelled by other means (i.e. from within itself) "
"that would also cancel ``shield()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If it is desired to completely ignore cancellation (not recommended) the "
"``shield()`` function should be combined with a try/except clause, as "
"follows::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Save a reference to tasks passed to this function, to avoid a task "
"disappearing mid-execution. The event loop only keeps weak references to "
"tasks. A task that isn't referenced elsewhere may get garbage collected at "
"any time, even before it's done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Deprecation warning is emitted if *aw* is not Future-like object and there "
"is no running event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Timeouts"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Wait for the *aw* :ref:`awaitable <asyncio-awaitables>` to complete with a "
"timeout."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*timeout* can either be ``None`` or a float or int number of seconds to wait "
"for.  If *timeout* is ``None``, block until the future completes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a timeout occurs, it cancels the task and raises :exc:`asyncio."
"TimeoutError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To avoid the task :meth:`cancellation <Task.cancel>`, wrap it in :func:"
"`shield`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function will wait until the future is actually cancelled, so the total "
"wait time may exceed the *timeout*. If an exception happens during "
"cancellation, it is propagated."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the wait is cancelled, the future *aw* is also cancelled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When *aw* is cancelled due to a timeout, ``wait_for`` waits for *aw* to be "
"cancelled.  Previously, it raised :exc:`asyncio.TimeoutError` immediately."
msgstr ""

msgid "Waiting Primitives"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Run :ref:`awaitable objects <asyncio-awaitables>` in the *aws* iterable "
"concurrently and block until the condition specified by *return_when*."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *aws* iterable must not be empty."
msgstr ""

msgid "Returns two sets of Tasks/Futures: ``(done, pending)``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Usage::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*timeout* (a float or int), if specified, can be used to control the maximum "
"number of seconds to wait before returning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that this function does not raise :exc:`asyncio.TimeoutError`. Futures "
"or Tasks that aren't done when the timeout occurs are simply returned in the "
"second set."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*return_when* indicates when this function should return.  It must be one of "
"the following constants:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Constant"
msgstr "Stała"

msgid "Description"
msgstr "Opis"

msgid ":const:`FIRST_COMPLETED`"
msgstr ""

msgid "The function will return when any future finishes or is cancelled."
msgstr ""

msgid ":const:`FIRST_EXCEPTION`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function will return when any future finishes by raising an exception.  "
"If no future raises an exception then it is equivalent to :const:"
"`ALL_COMPLETED`."
msgstr ""

msgid ":const:`ALL_COMPLETED`"
msgstr ""

msgid "The function will return when all futures finish or are cancelled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike :func:`~asyncio.wait_for`, ``wait()`` does not cancel the futures "
"when a timeout occurs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If any awaitable in *aws* is a coroutine, it is automatically scheduled as a "
"Task.  Passing coroutines objects to ``wait()`` directly is deprecated as it "
"leads to :ref:`confusing behavior <asyncio_example_wait_coroutine>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``wait()`` schedules coroutines as Tasks automatically and later returns "
"those implicitly created Task objects in ``(done, pending)`` sets.  "
"Therefore the following code won't work as expected::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here is how the above snippet can be fixed::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Passing coroutine objects to ``wait()`` directly is deprecated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Run :ref:`awaitable objects <asyncio-awaitables>` in the *aws* iterable "
"concurrently.  Return an iterator of coroutines. Each coroutine returned can "
"be awaited to get the earliest next result from the iterable of the "
"remaining awaitables."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises :exc:`asyncio.TimeoutError` if the timeout occurs before all Futures "
"are done."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Deprecation warning is emitted if not all awaitable objects in the *aws* "
"iterable are Future-like objects and there is no running event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running in Threads"
msgstr ""

msgid "Asynchronously run function *func* in a separate thread."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any \\*args and \\*\\*kwargs supplied for this function are directly passed "
"to *func*. Also, the current :class:`contextvars.Context` is propagated, "
"allowing context variables from the event loop thread to be accessed in the "
"separate thread."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a coroutine that can be awaited to get the eventual result of *func*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This coroutine function is primarily intended to be used for executing IO-"
"bound functions/methods that would otherwise block the event loop if they "
"were ran in the main thread. For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Directly calling ``blocking_io()`` in any coroutine would block the event "
"loop for its duration, resulting in an additional 1 second of run time. "
"Instead, by using ``asyncio.to_thread()``, we can run it in a separate "
"thread without blocking the event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Due to the :term:`GIL`, ``asyncio.to_thread()`` can typically only be used "
"to make IO-bound functions non-blocking. However, for extension modules that "
"release the GIL or alternative Python implementations that don't have one, "
"``asyncio.to_thread()`` can also be used for CPU-bound functions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scheduling From Other Threads"
msgstr ""

msgid "Submit a coroutine to the given event loop.  Thread-safe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a :class:`concurrent.futures.Future` to wait for the result from "
"another OS thread."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is meant to be called from a different OS thread than the one "
"where the event loop is running.  Example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an exception is raised in the coroutine, the returned Future will be "
"notified.  It can also be used to cancel the task in the event loop::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the :ref:`concurrency and multithreading <asyncio-multithreading>` "
"section of the documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike other asyncio functions this function requires the *loop* argument to "
"be passed explicitly."
msgstr ""

msgid "Introspection"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the currently running :class:`Task` instance, or ``None`` if no task "
"is running."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *loop* is ``None`` :func:`get_running_loop` is used to get the current "
"loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return a set of not yet finished :class:`Task` objects run by the loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *loop* is ``None``, :func:`get_running_loop` is used for getting current "
"loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Task Object"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :class:`Future-like <Future>` object that runs a Python :ref:`coroutine "
"<coroutine>`.  Not thread-safe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tasks are used to run coroutines in event loops. If a coroutine awaits on a "
"Future, the Task suspends the execution of the coroutine and waits for the "
"completion of the Future.  When the Future is *done*, the execution of the "
"wrapped coroutine resumes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Event loops use cooperative scheduling: an event loop runs one Task at a "
"time.  While a Task awaits for the completion of a Future, the event loop "
"runs other Tasks, callbacks, or performs IO operations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use the high-level :func:`asyncio.create_task` function to create Tasks, or "
"the low-level :meth:`loop.create_task` or :func:`ensure_future` functions.  "
"Manual instantiation of Tasks is discouraged."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To cancel a running Task use the :meth:`cancel` method.  Calling it will "
"cause the Task to throw a :exc:`CancelledError` exception into the wrapped "
"coroutine.  If a coroutine is awaiting on a Future object during "
"cancellation, the Future object will be cancelled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`cancelled` can be used to check if the Task was cancelled. The method "
"returns ``True`` if the wrapped coroutine did not suppress the :exc:"
"`CancelledError` exception and was actually cancelled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`asyncio.Task` inherits from :class:`Future` all of its APIs except :"
"meth:`Future.set_result` and :meth:`Future.set_exception`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tasks support the :mod:`contextvars` module.  When a Task is created it "
"copies the current context and later runs its coroutine in the copied "
"context."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support for the :mod:`contextvars` module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Deprecation warning is emitted if *loop* is not specified and there is no "
"running event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Request the Task to be cancelled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This arranges for a :exc:`CancelledError` exception to be thrown into the "
"wrapped coroutine on the next cycle of the event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The coroutine then has a chance to clean up or even deny the request by "
"suppressing the exception with a :keyword:`try` ... ... ``except "
"CancelledError`` ... :keyword:`finally` block. Therefore, unlike :meth:"
"`Future.cancel`, :meth:`Task.cancel` does not guarantee that the Task will "
"be cancelled, although suppressing cancellation completely is not common and "
"is actively discouraged."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *msg* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following example illustrates how coroutines can intercept the "
"cancellation request::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Return ``True`` if the Task is *cancelled*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return ``True`` if the Task is *done*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Task is *done* when the wrapped coroutine either returned a value, raised "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the Task has been *cancelled*, this method raises a :exc:`CancelledError` "

msgstr ""

msgid "The frames are always ordered from oldest to newest."
msgstr ""

msgid "Only one stack frame is returned for a suspended coroutine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The optional *limit* argument sets the maximum number of frames to return; "
"by default all available frames are returned. The ordering of the returned "

msgstr ""

msgid "Print the stack or traceback for this Task."
msgstr ""

msgid "Generator-based Coroutines"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for generator-based coroutines is **deprecated** and is removed in "
"Python 3.11."

msgid ""
"Generator-based coroutines predate async/await syntax.  They are Python "
