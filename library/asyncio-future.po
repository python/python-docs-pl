msgstr ""

msgid "an instance of :class:`asyncio.Future`,"
msgstr ""

msgid "an instance of :class:`asyncio.Task`,"

msgid ""
"*obj* argument as is, if *obj* is a :class:`Future`, a :class:`Task`, or a "
"Future-like object (:func:`isfuture` is used for the test.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"a :class:`Task` object wrapping *obj*, if *obj* is a coroutine (:func:"
"`iscoroutine` is used for the test); in this case the coroutine will be "
"scheduled by ``ensure_future()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"a :class:`Task` object that would await on *obj*, if *obj* is an awaitable (:"
"func:`inspect.isawaitable` is used for the test.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "If *obj* is neither of the above a :exc:`TypeError` is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See also the :func:`create_task` function which is the preferred way for "
"creating new Tasks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Save a reference to the result of this function, to avoid a task "
"disappearing mid-execution."
msgstr ""

msgid "The function accepts any :term:`awaitable` object."

msgid ""
"Deprecation warning is emitted if *obj* is not a Future-like object and "

msgid "Future Object"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Future represents an eventual result of an asynchronous operation.  Not "
"thread-safe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Future is an :term:`awaitable` object.  Coroutines can await on Future "
"objects until they either have a result or an exception set, or until they "
"are cancelled. A Future can be awaited multiple times and the result is same."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Typically Futures are used to enable low-level callback-based code (e.g. in "
"protocols implemented using asyncio :ref:`transports <asyncio-transports-"
"protocols>`) to interoperate with high-level async/await code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The rule of thumb is to never expose Future objects in user-facing APIs, and "
"the recommended way to create a Future object is to call :meth:`loop."
"create_future`.  This way alternative event loop implementations can inject "
"their own optimized implementations of a Future object."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support for the :mod:`contextvars` module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Deprecation warning is emitted if *loop* is not specified and there is no "
"running event loop."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the result of the Future."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the Future is *done* and has a result set by the :meth:`set_result` "
"method, the result value is returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the Future is *done* and has an exception set by the :meth:"
"`set_exception` method, this method raises the exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the Future has been *cancelled*, this method raises a :exc:"
"`CancelledError` exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the Future's result isn't yet available, this method raises a :exc:"
"`InvalidStateError` exception."

msgid "Return ``True`` if the Future is *done*."

msgid ""
"A Future is *done* if it was *cancelled* or if it has a result or an "
"exception set with :meth:`set_result` or :meth:`set_exception` calls."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return ``True`` if the Future was *cancelled*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The method is usually used to check if a Future is not *cancelled* before "
"setting a result or an exception for it::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Add a callback to be run when the Future is *done*."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *callback* is called with the Future object as its only argument."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the Future is already *done* when this method is called, the callback is "
"scheduled with :meth:`loop.call_soon`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An optional keyword-only *context* argument allows specifying a custom :"
"class:`contextvars.Context` for the *callback* to run in. The current "
"context is used when no *context* is provided."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`functools.partial` can be used to pass parameters to the callback, e."
"g.::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *context* keyword-only parameter was added. See :pep:`567` for more "
"details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remove *callback* from the callbacks list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns the number of callbacks removed, which is typically 1, unless a "
"callback was added more than once."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cancel the Future and schedule callbacks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the Future is already *done* or *cancelled*, return ``False``. Otherwise, "
"change the Future's state to *cancelled*, schedule the callbacks, and return "
"``True``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *msg* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the exception that was set on this Future."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The exception (or ``None`` if no exception was set) is returned only if the "
"Future is *done*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the Future isn't *done* yet, this method raises an :exc:"
"`InvalidStateError` exception."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return the event loop the Future object is bound to."

msgid ""
"This example creates a Future object, creates and schedules an asynchronous "
"Task to set result for the Future, and waits until the Future has a result::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Future object was designed to mimic :class:`concurrent.futures.Future`.  "
"Key differences include:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"unlike asyncio Futures, :class:`concurrent.futures.Future` instances cannot "
"be awaited."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`asyncio.Future.result` and :meth:`asyncio.Future.exception` do not "
"accept the *timeout* argument."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`asyncio.Future.result` and :meth:`asyncio.Future.exception` raise an :"
"exc:`InvalidStateError` exception when the Future is not *done*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Callbacks registered with :meth:`asyncio.Future.add_done_callback` are not "
"called immediately.  They are scheduled with :meth:`loop.call_soon` instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"asyncio Future is not compatible with the :func:`concurrent.futures.wait` "
"and :func:`concurrent.futures.as_completed` functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`asyncio.Future.cancel` accepts an optional ``msg`` argument, but :"
"func:`concurrent.futures.cancel` does not."
