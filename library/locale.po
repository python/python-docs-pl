"The :mod:`locale` module opens access to the POSIX locale database and "

msgid "Background, details, hints, tips and caveats"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The C standard defines the locale as a program-wide property that may be "
"relatively expensive to change.  On top of that, some implementations are "
"broken in such a way that frequent locale changes may cause core dumps.  "
"This makes the locale somewhat painful to use correctly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Initially, when a program is started, the locale is the ``C`` locale, no "
"matter what the user's preferred locale is.  There is one exception: the :"
"data:`LC_CTYPE` category is changed at startup to set the current locale "
"encoding to the user's preferred locale encoding. The program must "
"explicitly say that it wants the user's preferred locale settings for other "
"categories by calling ``setlocale(LC_ALL, '')``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is generally a bad idea to call :func:`setlocale` in some library "
"routine, since as a side effect it affects the entire program.  Saving and "
"restoring it is almost as bad: it is expensive and affects other threads "
"that happen to run before the settings have been restored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If, when coding a module for general use, you need a locale independent "
"version of an operation that is affected by the locale (such as certain "
"formats used with :func:`time.strftime`), you will have to find a way to do "
"it without using the standard library routine.  Even better is convincing "
"yourself that using locale settings is okay.  Only as a last resort should "
"you document that your module is not compatible with non-\\ ``C`` locale "
"settings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The only way to perform numeric operations according to the locale is to use "
"the special functions defined by this module: :func:`atof`, :func:`atoi`, :"
"func:`format_string`, :func:`.str`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is no way to perform case conversions and character classifications "
"according to the locale.  For (Unicode) text strings these are done "
"according to the character value only, while for byte strings, the "
"conversions and classifications are done according to the ASCII value of the "
"byte, and bytes whose high bit is set (i.e., non-ASCII bytes) are never "
"converted or considered part of a character class such as letter or "
"whitespace."
msgstr ""

msgid "For extension writers and programs that embed Python"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Extension modules should never call :func:`setlocale`, except to find out "
"what the current locale is.  But since the return value can only be used "
"portably to restore it, that is not very useful (except perhaps to find out "
"whether or not the locale is ``C``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When Python code uses the :mod:`locale` module to change the locale, this "
"also affects the embedding application.  If the embedding application "
"doesn't want this to happen, it should remove the :mod:`_locale` extension "
"module (which does all the work) from the table of built-in modules in the :"
"file:`config.c` file, and make sure that the :mod:`_locale` module is not "
"accessible as a shared library."
msgstr ""

msgid "Access to message catalogs"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The locale module exposes the C library's gettext interface on systems that "
"provide this interface.  It consists of the functions :func:`!gettext`, :"
"func:`!dgettext`, :func:`!dcgettext`, :func:`!textdomain`, :func:`!"
"bindtextdomain`, and :func:`!bind_textdomain_codeset`.  These are similar to "
"the same functions in the :mod:`gettext` module, but use the C library's "
"binary format for message catalogs, and the C library's search algorithms "
"for locating message catalogs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python applications should normally find no need to invoke these functions, "
"and should use :mod:`gettext` instead.  A known exception to this rule are "
"applications that link with additional C libraries which internally invoke :"
"c:func:`gettext` or :c:func:`dcgettext`.  For these applications, it may be "
