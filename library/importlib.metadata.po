msgid "``importlib.metadata`` is no longer provisional."

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/importlib/metadata/__init__.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``importlib.metadata`` is a library that provides access to the metadata of "
"an installed `Distribution Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/"
"glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_, such as its entry points or its top-"
"level names (`Import Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/"
"glossary/#term-Import-Package>`_\\s, modules, if any). Built in part on "
"Python's import system, this library intends to replace similar "
"functionality in the `entry point API`_ and `metadata API`_ of "
"``pkg_resources``.  Along with :mod:`importlib.resources`, this package can "
"eliminate the need to use the older and less efficient ``pkg_resources`` "
"package."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``importlib.metadata`` operates on third-party *distribution packages* "
"installed into Python's ``site-packages`` directory via tools such as `pip "
"<https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_. Specifically, it works with distributions "
"with discoverable ``dist-info`` or ``egg-info`` directories, and metadata "
"defined by the `Core metadata specifications <https://packaging.python.org/"
"en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#core-metadata>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These are *not* necessarily equivalent to or correspond 1:1 with the top-"
"level *import package* names that can be imported inside Python code. One "
"*distribution package* can contain multiple *import packages* (and single "
"modules), and one top-level *import package* may map to multiple "
"*distribution packages* if it is a namespace package. You can use :ref:"
"`package_distributions() <package-distributions>` to get a mapping between "
"them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, distribution metadata can live on the file system or in zip "
"archives on :data:`sys.path`.  Through an extension mechanism, the metadata "
"can live almost anywhere."

"Let's say you wanted to get the version string for a `Distribution Package "
"<https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-"

"environment and installing something into it:"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can get the version string for ``wheel`` by running the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also get a collection of entry points selectable by properties of "
"the EntryPoint (typically 'group' or 'name'), such as ``console_scripts``, "
"``distutils.commands`` and others.  Each group contains a collection of :ref:"
"`EntryPoint <entry-points>` objects."

msgid "Functional API"
msgstr ""

msgid "This package provides the following functionality via its public API."
msgstr ""

msgid "Entry points"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``entry_points()`` function returns a collection of entry points. Entry "
"points are represented by ``EntryPoint`` instances; each ``EntryPoint`` has "
"a ``.name``, ``.group``, and ``.value`` attributes and a ``.load()`` method "
"to resolve the value.  There are also ``.module``, ``.attr``, and ``."
"extras`` attributes for getting the components of the ``.value`` attribute."
msgstr ""

msgid "Query all entry points::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``entry_points()`` function returns an ``EntryPoints`` object, a "
"collection of all ``EntryPoint`` objects with ``names`` and ``groups`` "
"attributes for convenience::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``EntryPoints`` has a ``select`` method to select entry points matching "
"specific properties. Select entry points in the ``console_scripts`` group::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Equivalently, since ``entry_points`` passes keyword arguments through to "
"select::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pick out a specific script named \"wheel\" (found in the wheel project)::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Equivalently, query for that entry point during selection::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Inspect the resolved entry point::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``group`` and ``name`` are arbitrary values defined by the package "
"author and usually a client will wish to resolve all entry points for a "
"particular group.  Read `the setuptools docs <https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/"
"latest/userguide/entry_point.html>`_ for more information on entry points, "
"their definition, and usage."
msgstr ""

msgid "*Compatibility Note*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"selectable\" entry points were introduced in ``importlib_metadata`` "
"3.6 and Python 3.10. Prior to those changes, ``entry_points`` accepted no "
"parameters and always returned a dictionary of entry points, keyed by group. "
"With ``importlib_metadata`` 5.0 and Python 3.12, ``entry_points`` always "
"returns an ``EntryPoints`` object. See `backports.entry_points_selectable "
"<https://pypi.org/project/backports.entry-points-selectable>`_ for "
"compatibility options."
msgstr ""

msgid "Distribution metadata"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every `Distribution Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/"
"#term-Distribution-Package>`_ includes some metadata, which you can extract "
"using the ``metadata()`` function::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The keys of the returned data structure, a ``PackageMetadata``, name the "
"metadata keywords, and the values are returned unparsed from the "
"distribution metadata::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``PackageMetadata`` also presents a ``json`` attribute that returns all the "
"metadata in a JSON-compatible form per :PEP:`566`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The actual type of the object returned by ``metadata()`` is an "
"implementation detail and should be accessed only through the interface "
"described by the `PackageMetadata protocol <https://importlib-metadata."
"readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#importlib_metadata.PackageMetadata>`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``Description`` is now included in the metadata when presented through "
"the payload. Line continuation characters have been removed."
msgstr ""

msgid "The ``json`` attribute was added."

msgid "Distribution versions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``version()`` function is the quickest way to get a `Distribution "
"Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-"
"Package>`_'s version number, as a string::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Distribution files"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also get the full set of files contained within a distribution.  The "
"``files()`` function takes a `Distribution Package <https://packaging.python."
"org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_ name and returns all of "
"the files installed by this distribution.  Each file object returned is a "
"``PackagePath``, a :class:`pathlib.PurePath` derived object with additional "
"``dist``, ``size``, and ``hash`` properties as indicated by the metadata.  "
"For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Once you have the file, you can also read its contents::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also use the ``locate`` method to get a the absolute path to the "
"file::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the case where the metadata file listing files (RECORD or SOURCES.txt) is "
"missing, ``files()`` will return ``None``. The caller may wish to wrap calls "
"to ``files()`` in `always_iterable <https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/"
"stable/api.html#more_itertools.always_iterable>`_ or otherwise guard against "
"this condition if the target distribution is not known to have the metadata "
"present."
msgstr ""

msgid "Distribution requirements"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get the full set of requirements for a `Distribution Package <https://"
"packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_, use "
"the ``requires()`` function::"

msgid "Mapping import to distribution packages"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A convenience method to resolve the `Distribution Package <https://packaging."
"python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_ name (or names, "
"in the case of a namespace package) that provide each importable top-level "
"Python module or `Import Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/"
"glossary/#term-Import-Package>`_::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some editable installs, `do not supply top-level names <https://github.com/"
"pypa/packaging-problems/issues/609>`_, and thus this function is not "
"reliable with such installs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Distributions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While the above API is the most common and convenient usage, you can get all "
"of that information from the ``Distribution`` class.  A ``Distribution`` is "
"an abstract object that represents the metadata for a Python `Distribution "
"Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-"
"Package>`_.  You can get the ``Distribution`` instance::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Thus, an alternative way to get the version number is through the "
"``Distribution`` instance::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are all kinds of additional metadata available on the ``Distribution`` "
"instance::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The full set of available metadata is not described here. See the `Core "
"metadata specifications <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/"
"specifications/core-metadata/#core-metadata>`_ for additional details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Distribution Discovery"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, this package provides built-in support for discovery of metadata "
"for file system and zip file `Distribution Package <https://packaging.python."
"org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_\\s. This metadata "
"finder search defaults to ``sys.path``, but varies slightly in how it "
"interprets those values from how other import machinery does. In particular:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``importlib.metadata`` does not honor :class:`bytes` objects on ``sys.path``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``importlib.metadata`` will incidentally honor :py:class:`pathlib.Path` "
"objects on ``sys.path`` even though such values will be ignored for imports."
msgstr ""

msgid "Extending the search algorithm"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because `Distribution Package <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/"
"glossary/#term-Distribution-Package>`_ metadata is not available through :"
"data:`sys.path` searches, or package loaders directly, the metadata for a "
"distribution is found through import system :ref:`finders <finders-and-"
"loaders>`.  To find a distribution package's metadata, ``importlib."
"metadata`` queries the list of :term:`meta path finders <meta path finder>` "
"on :data:`sys.meta_path`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default ``importlib.metadata`` installs a finder for distribution "
"packages found on the file system. This finder doesn't actually find any "
"*distributions*, but it can find their metadata."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The abstract class :py:class:`importlib.abc.MetaPathFinder` defines the "
"interface expected of finders by Python's import system. ``importlib."
"metadata`` extends this protocol by looking for an optional "
"``find_distributions`` callable on the finders from :data:`sys.meta_path` "
"and presents this extended interface as the ``DistributionFinder`` abstract "
"base class, which defines this abstract method::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``DistributionFinder.Context`` object provides ``.path`` and ``.name`` "
"properties indicating the path to search and name to match and may supply "
"other relevant context."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"What this means in practice is that to support finding distribution package "
"metadata in locations other than the file system, subclass ``Distribution`` "
"and implement the abstract methods. Then from a custom finder, return "
"instances of this derived ``Distribution`` in the ``find_distributions()`` "
"method."
