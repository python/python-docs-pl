msgid ":mod:`http.cookies` --- HTTP state management"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/http/cookies.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`http.cookies` module defines classes for abstracting the concept "
"of cookies, an HTTP state management mechanism. It supports both simple "
"string-only cookies, and provides an abstraction for having any serializable "
"data-type as cookie value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module formerly strictly applied the parsing rules described in the :rfc:"
"`2109` and :rfc:`2068` specifications.  It has since been discovered that "
"MSIE 3.0x doesn't follow the character rules outlined in those specs and "
"also many current day browsers and servers have relaxed parsing rules when "
"comes to Cookie handling.  As a result, the parsing rules used are a bit "
"less strict."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The character set, :data:`string.ascii_letters`, :data:`string.digits` and "
"``!#$%&'*+-.^_`|~:`` denote the set of valid characters allowed by this "
"module in Cookie name (as :attr:`~Morsel.key`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Allowed ':' as a valid Cookie name character."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On encountering an invalid cookie, :exc:`CookieError` is raised, so if your "
"cookie data comes from a browser you should always prepare for invalid data "
"and catch :exc:`CookieError` on parsing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exception failing because of :rfc:`2109` invalidity: incorrect attributes, "
"incorrect :mailheader:`Set-Cookie` header, etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This class is a dictionary-like object whose keys are strings and whose "
"values are :class:`Morsel` instances. Note that upon setting a key to a "
"value, the value is first converted to a :class:`Morsel` containing the key "
"and the value."
msgstr ""

msgid "If *input* is given, it is passed to the :meth:`load` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This class derives from :class:`BaseCookie` and overrides :meth:"
"`value_decode` and :meth:`value_encode`. SimpleCookie supports strings as "
"cookie values. When setting the value, SimpleCookie calls the builtin :func:"
"`str()` to convert the value to a string. Values received from HTTP are kept "
"as strings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Module :mod:`http.cookiejar`"

msgid ""
"HTTP cookie handling for web *clients*.  The :mod:`http.cookiejar` and :mod:"

msgid "Cookie Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a tuple ``(real_value, coded_value)`` from a string representation. "
"``real_value`` can be any type. This method does no decoding in :class:"
"`BaseCookie` --- it exists so it can be overridden."

msgid ""
"Return a tuple ``(real_value, coded_value)``. *val* can be any type, but "
"``coded_value`` will always be converted to a string. This method does no "
"encoding in :class:`BaseCookie` --- it exists so it can be overridden."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, it should be the case that :meth:`value_encode` and :meth:"
"`value_decode` are inverses on the range of *value_decode*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a string representation suitable to be sent as HTTP headers. *attrs* "
"and *header* are sent to each :class:`Morsel`'s :meth:`output` method. *sep* "
"is used to join the headers together, and is by default the combination "
"``'\\r\\n'`` (CRLF)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return an embeddable JavaScript snippet, which, if run on a browser which "
"supports JavaScript, will act the same as if the HTTP headers was sent."
msgstr ""

msgid "The meaning for *attrs* is the same as in :meth:`output`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *rawdata* is a string, parse it as an ``HTTP_COOKIE`` and add the values "

msgid ""
"The attribute :attr:`httponly` specifies that the cookie is only transferred "
"in HTTP requests, and is not accessible through JavaScript. This is intended "
"to mitigate some forms of cross-site scripting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The attribute :attr:`samesite` specifies that the browser is not allowed to "
"send the cookie along with cross-site requests. This helps to mitigate CSRF "
"attacks. Valid values for this attribute are \"Strict\" and \"Lax\"."
