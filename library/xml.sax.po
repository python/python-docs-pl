msgid ":mod:`xml.sax` --- Support for SAX2 parsers"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/xml/sax/__init__.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`xml.sax` package provides a number of modules which implement the "
"Simple API for XML (SAX) interface for Python.  The package itself provides "
"the SAX exceptions and the convenience functions which will be most used by "
"users of the SAX API."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`xml.sax` module is not secure against maliciously constructed "
"data.  If you need to parse untrusted or unauthenticated data see :ref:`xml-"
"vulnerabilities`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The SAX parser no longer processes general external entities by default to "
"increase security. Before, the parser created network connections to fetch "
"remote files or loaded local files from the file system for DTD and "
"entities. The feature can be enabled again with method :meth:`~xml.sax."
"xmlreader.XMLReader.setFeature` on the parser object and argument :data:"
"`~xml.sax.handler.feature_external_ges`."
msgstr ""

msgid "The convenience functions are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create and return a SAX :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.XMLReader` object.  The "
"first parser found will be used.  If *parser_list* is provided, it must be "
"an iterable of strings which name modules that have a function named :func:"
"`create_parser`.  Modules listed in *parser_list* will be used before "
"modules in the default list of parsers."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *parser_list* argument can be any iterable, not just a list."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a SAX parser and use it to parse a document.  The document, passed in "
"as *filename_or_stream*, can be a filename or a file object.  The *handler* "
"parameter needs to be a SAX :class:`~handler.ContentHandler` instance.  If "
"*error_handler* is given, it must be a SAX :class:`~handler.ErrorHandler` "
"instance; if omitted,  :exc:`SAXParseException` will be raised on all "
"errors.  There is no return value; all work must be done by the *handler* "
"passed in."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :func:`parse`, but parses from a buffer *string* received as a "
"parameter.  *string* must be a :class:`str` instance or a :term:`bytes-like "
"object`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support of :class:`str` instances."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A typical SAX application uses three kinds of objects: readers, handlers and "
"input sources.  \"Reader\" in this context is another term for parser, i.e. "
"some piece of code that reads the bytes or characters from the input source, "
"and produces a sequence of events. The events then get distributed to the "
"handler objects, i.e. the reader invokes a method on the handler.  A SAX "
"application must therefore obtain a reader object, create or open the input "
"sources, create the handlers, and connect these objects all together.  As "
"the final step of preparation, the reader is called to parse the input. "
"During parsing, methods on the handler objects are called based on "
"structural and syntactic events from the input data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For these objects, only the interfaces are relevant; they are normally not "
"instantiated by the application itself.  Since Python does not have an "
"explicit notion of interface, they are formally introduced as classes, but "
"applications may use implementations which do not inherit from the provided "
"classes.  The :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource`, :class:`~xml.sax."
"xmlreader.Locator`, :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.Attributes`, :class:`~xml.sax."
"xmlreader.AttributesNS`, and :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.XMLReader` "
"interfaces are defined in the module :mod:`xml.sax.xmlreader`.  The handler "
"interfaces are defined in :mod:`xml.sax.handler`.  For convenience, :class:"
"`~xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource` (which is often instantiated directly) and "
"the handler classes are also available from :mod:`xml.sax`.  These "
"interfaces are described below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition to these classes, :mod:`xml.sax` provides the following "
"exception classes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Encapsulate an XML error or warning.  This class can contain basic error or "
"warning information from either the XML parser or the application: it can be "
"subclassed to provide additional functionality or to add localization.  Note "
"that although the handlers defined in the :class:`~xml.sax.handler."
"ErrorHandler` interface receive instances of this exception, it is not "
"required to actually raise the exception --- it is also useful as a "
"container for information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When instantiated, *msg* should be a human-readable description of the "
"error. The optional *exception* parameter, if given, should be ``None`` or "
"an exception that was caught by the parsing code and is being passed along "
"as information."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the base class for the other SAX exception classes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subclass of :exc:`SAXException` raised on parse errors. Instances of this "
"class are passed to the methods of the SAX :class:`~xml.sax.handler."
"ErrorHandler` interface to provide information about the parse error.  This "
"class supports the SAX :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.Locator` interface as well "
"as the :class:`SAXException` interface."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subclass of :exc:`SAXException` raised when a SAX :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader."
"XMLReader` is confronted with an unrecognized feature or property.  SAX "
"applications and extensions may use this class for similar purposes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subclass of :exc:`SAXException` raised when a SAX :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader."
"XMLReader` is asked to enable a feature that is not supported, or to set a "
"property to a value that the implementation does not support.  SAX "
"applications and extensions may use this class for similar purposes."
