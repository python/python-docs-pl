msgid ":mod:`!bisect` --- Array bisection algorithm"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/bisect.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without "
"having to sort the list after each insertion.  For long lists of items with "
"expensive comparison operations, this can be an improvement over linear "
"searches or frequent resorting."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module is called :mod:`bisect` because it uses a basic bisection "
"algorithm to do its work.  Unlike other bisection tools that search for a "
"specific value, the functions in this module are designed to locate an "
"insertion point. Accordingly, the functions never call an :meth:`~object."
"__eq__` method to determine whether a value has been found.  Instead, the "
"functions only call the :meth:`~object.__lt__` method and will return an "
"insertion point between values in an array."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following functions are provided:"
msgstr "W module znajdują się następujące funkcje:"

msgid ""
"Locate the insertion point for *x* in *a* to maintain sorted order. The "
"parameters *lo* and *hi* may be used to specify a subset of the list which "
"should be considered; by default the entire list is used.  If *x* is already "
"present in *a*, the insertion point will be before (to the left of) any "
"existing entries.  The return value is suitable for use as the first "
"parameter to ``list.insert()`` assuming that *a* is already sorted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The returned insertion point *ip* partitions the array *a* into two slices "
"such that ``all(elem < x for elem in a[lo : ip])`` is true for the left "
"slice and ``all(elem >= x for elem in a[ip : hi])`` is true for the right "
"slice."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*key* specifies a :term:`key function` of one argument that is used to "
"extract a comparison key from each element in the array.  To support "
"searching complex records, the key function is not applied to the *x* value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *key* is ``None``, the elements are compared directly and no key function "
"is called."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *key* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :py:func:`~bisect.bisect_left`, but returns an insertion point "
"which comes after (to the right of) any existing entries of *x* in *a*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The returned insertion point *ip* partitions the array *a* into two slices "
"such that ``all(elem <= x for elem in a[lo : ip])`` is true for the left "
"slice and ``all(elem > x for elem in a[ip : hi])`` is true for the right "
"slice."
msgstr ""

msgid "Insert *x* in *a* in sorted order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function first runs :py:func:`~bisect.bisect_left` to locate an "
"insertion point. Next, it runs the :meth:`!insert` method on *a* to insert "
"*x* at the appropriate position to maintain sort order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To support inserting records in a table, the *key* function (if any) is "
"applied to *x* for the search step but not for the insertion step."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Keep in mind that the *O*\\ (log *n*) search is dominated by the slow *O*\\ "
"(*n*) insertion step."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :py:func:`~bisect.insort_left`, but inserting *x* in *a* after "
"any existing entries of *x*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function first runs :py:func:`~bisect.bisect_right` to locate an "
"insertion point. Next, it runs the :meth:`!insert` method on *a* to insert "
"*x* at the appropriate position to maintain sort order."
msgstr ""

msgid "Performance Notes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When writing time sensitive code using *bisect()* and *insort()*, keep these "
"thoughts in mind:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Bisection is effective for searching ranges of values. For locating specific "
"values, dictionaries are more performant."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *insort()* functions are *O*\\ (*n*) because the logarithmic search step "
"is dominated by the linear time insertion step."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The search functions are stateless and discard key function results after "
"they are used.  Consequently, if the search functions are used in a loop, "
"the key function may be called again and again on the same array elements. "
"If the key function isn't fast, consider wrapping it with :py:func:"
"`functools.cache` to avoid duplicate computations.  Alternatively, consider "
"searching an array of precomputed keys to locate the insertion point (as "
"shown in the examples section below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Sorted Collections <https://grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcollections/>`_ is a "
"high performance module that uses *bisect* to managed sorted collections of "
"data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `SortedCollection recipe <https://code.activestate.com/recipes/577197-"
"sortedcollection/>`_ uses bisect to build a full-featured collection class "
"with straight-forward search methods and support for a key-function.  The "
"keys are precomputed to save unnecessary calls to the key function during "
"searches."
msgstr ""

msgid "Searching Sorted Lists"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The above `bisect functions`_ are useful for finding insertion points but "
"can be tricky or awkward to use for common searching tasks. The following "
"five functions show how to transform them into the standard lookups for "
"sorted lists::"
