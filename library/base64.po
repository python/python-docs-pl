"This module provides functions for encoding binary data to printable ASCII "
"characters and decoding such encodings back to binary data. It provides "
"encoding and decoding functions for the encodings specified in :rfc:`4648`, "
"which defines the Base16, Base32, and Base64 algorithms, and for the de-"
"facto standard Ascii85 and Base85 encodings."

msgid ""
"The :rfc:`4648` encodings are suitable for encoding binary data so that it "
"can be safely sent by email, used as parts of URLs, or included as part of "
"an HTTP POST request.  The encoding algorithm is not the same as the :"
"program:`uuencode` program."

msgid ""
"There are two interfaces provided by this module.  The modern interface "
"supports encoding :term:`bytes-like objects <bytes-like object>` to ASCII :"
"class:`bytes`, and decoding :term:`bytes-like objects <bytes-like object>` "

"defined in :rfc:`4648` (normal, and URL- and filesystem-safe) are supported."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The legacy interface does not support decoding from strings, but it does "
"provide functions for encoding and decoding to and from :term:`file objects "
"<file object>`.  It only supports the Base64 standard alphabet, and it adds "
"newlines every 76 characters as per :rfc:`2045`.  Note that if you are "
