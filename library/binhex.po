"This module encodes and decodes files in binhex4 format, a format allowing "
"representation of Macintosh files in ASCII. Only the data fork is handled."

msgid "The :mod:`binhex` module defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Convert a binary file with filename *input* to binhex file *output*. The "
"*output* parameter can either be a filename or a file-like object (any "
"object supporting a :meth:`write` and :meth:`close` method)."

msgid ""
"Decode a binhex file *input*. *input* may be a filename or a file-like "
"object supporting :meth:`read` and :meth:`close` methods. The resulting file "
"is written to a file named *output*, unless the argument is ``None`` in "
"which case the output filename is read from the binhex file."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following exception is also defined:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exception raised when something can't be encoded using the binhex format "

"input is not properly encoded binhex data."

msgid ""
"Support module containing ASCII-to-binary and binary-to-ASCII conversions."

"There is an alternative, more powerful interface to the coder and decoder, "

"If you code or decode textfiles on non-Macintosh platforms they will still "
