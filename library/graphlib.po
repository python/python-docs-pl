msgid ":mod:`graphlib` --- Functionality to operate with graph-like structures"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/graphlib.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Provides functionality to topologically sort a graph of :term:`hashable` "
"nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A topological order is a linear ordering of the vertices in a graph such "
"that for every directed edge u -> v from vertex u to vertex v, vertex u "
"comes before vertex v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the "
"graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges may represent "
"constraints that one task must be performed before another; in this example, "
"a topological ordering is just a valid sequence for the tasks. A complete "
"topological ordering is possible if and only if the graph has no directed "
"cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the optional *graph* argument is provided it must be a dictionary "
"representing a directed acyclic graph where the keys are nodes and the "
"values are iterables of all predecessors of that node in the graph (the "
"nodes that have edges that point to the value in the key). Additional nodes "
"can be added to the graph using the :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.add` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the general case, the steps required to perform the sorting of a given "
"graph are as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create an instance of the :class:`TopologicalSorter` with an optional "
"initial graph."
msgstr ""

msgid "Add additional nodes to the graph."
msgstr ""

msgid "Call :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare` on the graph."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.is_active` is ``True``, iterate over the "
"nodes returned by :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.get_ready` and process them. "
"Call :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.done` on each node as it finishes processing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In case just an immediate sorting of the nodes in the graph is required and "
"no parallelism is involved, the convenience method :meth:`TopologicalSorter."
"static_order` can be used directly:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The class is designed to easily support parallel processing of the nodes as "
"they become ready. For instance::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Add a new node and its predecessors to the graph. Both the *node* and all "
"elements in *predecessors* must be :term:`hashable`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If called multiple times with the same node argument, the set of "
"dependencies will be the union of all dependencies passed in."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is possible to add a node with no dependencies (*predecessors* is not "
"provided) or to provide a dependency twice. If a node that has not been "
"provided before is included among *predecessors* it will be automatically "
"added to the graph with no predecessors of its own."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises :exc:`ValueError` if called after :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Mark the graph as finished and check for cycles in the graph. If any cycle "
"is detected, :exc:`CycleError` will be raised, but :meth:`~TopologicalSorter."
"get_ready` can still be used to obtain as many nodes as possible until "
"cycles block more progress. After a call to this function, the graph cannot "
"be modified, and therefore no more nodes can be added using :meth:"
"`~TopologicalSorter.add`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns ``True`` if more progress can be made and ``False`` otherwise. "
"Progress can be made if cycles do not block the resolution and either there "
"are still nodes ready that haven't yet been returned by :meth:"
"`TopologicalSorter.get_ready` or the number of nodes marked :meth:"
"`TopologicalSorter.done` is less than the number that have been returned by :"
"meth:`TopologicalSorter.get_ready`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.__bool__` method of this class defers to this "
"function, so instead of::"
msgstr ""

msgid "it is possible to simply do::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises :exc:`ValueError` if called without calling :meth:`~TopologicalSorter."
"prepare` previously."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Marks a set of nodes returned by :meth:`TopologicalSorter.get_ready` as "
"processed, unblocking any successor of each node in *nodes* for being "
"returned in the future by a call to :meth:`TopologicalSorter.get_ready`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises :exc:`ValueError` if any node in *nodes* has already been marked as "
"processed by a previous call to this method or if a node was not added to "
"the graph by using :meth:`TopologicalSorter.add`, if called without calling :"
"meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare` or if node has not yet been returned by :"
"meth:`~TopologicalSorter.get_ready`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a ``tuple`` with all the nodes that are ready. Initially it returns "
"all nodes with no predecessors, and once those are marked as processed by "
"calling :meth:`TopologicalSorter.done`, further calls will return all new "
"nodes that have all their predecessors already processed. Once no more "
"progress can be made, empty tuples are returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns an iterator object which will iterate over nodes in a topological "
"order. When using this method, :meth:`~TopologicalSorter.prepare` and :meth:"
"`~TopologicalSorter.done` should not be called. This method is equivalent "
"to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The particular order that is returned may depend on the specific order in "
"which the items were inserted in the graph. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is due to the fact that \"0\" and \"2\" are in the same level in the "
"graph (they would have been returned in the same call to :meth:"
"`~TopologicalSorter.get_ready`) and the order between them is determined by "
"the order of insertion."
msgstr ""

msgid "If any cycle is detected, :exc:`CycleError` will be raised."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exceptions"
msgstr "WyjÄ…tki"

msgid "The :mod:`graphlib` module defines the following exception classes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Subclass of :exc:`ValueError` raised by :meth:`TopologicalSorter.prepare` if "
"cycles exist in the working graph. If multiple cycles exist, only one "
"undefined choice among them will be reported and included in the exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The detected cycle can be accessed via the second element in the :attr:"
"`~CycleError.args` attribute of the exception instance and consists in a "
"list of nodes, such that each node is, in the graph, an immediate "
"predecessor of the next node in the list. In the reported list, the first "
"and the last node will be the same, to make it clear that it is cyclic."
