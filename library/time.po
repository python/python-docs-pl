msgid ""
"This module provides various time-related functions. For related "
"functionality, see also the :mod:`datetime` and :mod:`calendar` modules."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although this module is always available, not all functions are available on "
"all platforms.  Most of the functions defined in this module call platform C "
"library functions with the same name.  It may sometimes be helpful to "
"consult the platform documentation, because the semantics of these functions "
"varies among platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid "An explanation of some terminology and conventions is in order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :dfn:`epoch` is the point where the time starts, the return value of "
"``time.gmtime(0)``. It is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC) on all platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The term :dfn:`seconds since the epoch` refers to the total number of "
"elapsed seconds since the epoch, typically excluding `leap seconds`_.  Leap "
"seconds are excluded from this total on all POSIX-compliant platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The functions in this module may not handle dates and times before the "
"epoch_ or far in the future.  The cut-off point in the future is determined "
"by the C library; for 32-bit systems, it is typically in 2038."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Function :func:`strptime` can parse 2-digit years when given ``%y`` format "
"code. When 2-digit years are parsed, they are converted according to the "
"POSIX and ISO C standards: values 69--99 are mapped to 1969--1999, and "
"values 0--68 are mapped to 2000--2068."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"UTC is Coordinated Universal Time (formerly known as Greenwich Mean Time, or "
"GMT).  The acronym UTC is not a mistake but a compromise between English and "
"French."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"DST is Daylight Saving Time, an adjustment of the timezone by (usually) one "
"hour during part of the year.  DST rules are magic (determined by local law) "
"and can change from year to year.  The C library has a table containing the "
"local rules (often it is read from a system file for flexibility) and is the "
"only source of True Wisdom in this respect."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The precision of the various real-time functions may be less than suggested "
"by the units in which their value or argument is expressed. E.g. on most "
"Unix systems, the clock \"ticks\" only 50 or 100 times a second."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the other hand, the precision of :func:`.time` and :func:`sleep` is "
"better than their Unix equivalents: times are expressed as floating point "
"numbers, :func:`.time` returns the most accurate time available (using Unix :"
"c:func:`gettimeofday` where available), and :func:`sleep` will accept a time "
"with a nonzero fraction (Unix :c:func:`select` is used to implement this, "
"where available)."

msgid ""
"The time value as returned by :func:`gmtime`, :func:`localtime`, and :func:"
"`strptime`, and accepted by :func:`asctime`, :func:`mktime` and :func:"
