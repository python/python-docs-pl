msgid ":mod:`marshal` --- Internal Python object serialization"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module contains functions that can read and write Python values in a "
"binary format.  The format is specific to Python, but independent of machine "
"architecture issues (e.g., you can write a Python value to a file on a PC, "
"transport the file to a Sun, and read it back there).  Details of the format "
"are undocumented on purpose; it may change between Python versions (although "
"it rarely does). [#]_"

msgid ""
"This is not a general \"persistence\" module.  For general persistence and "
"transfer of Python objects through RPC calls, see the modules :mod:`pickle` "
"and :mod:`shelve`.  The :mod:`marshal` module exists mainly to support "
"reading and writing the \"pseudo-compiled\" code for Python modules of :file:"
"`.pyc` files. Therefore, the Python maintainers reserve the right to modify "
"the marshal format in backward incompatible ways should the need arise.  If "
"you're serializing and de-serializing Python objects, use the :mod:`pickle` "
"module instead -- the performance is comparable, version independence is "
"guaranteed, and pickle supports a substantially wider range of objects than "
"marshal."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`marshal` module is not intended to be secure against erroneous or "
"maliciously constructed data.  Never unmarshal data received from an "
"untrusted or unauthenticated source."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Not all Python object types are supported; in general, only objects whose "
"value is independent from a particular invocation of Python can be written "
"and read by this module.  The following types are supported: booleans, "
"integers, floating point numbers, complex numbers, strings, bytes, "
"bytearrays, tuples, lists, sets, frozensets, dictionaries, and code objects, "
"where it should be understood that tuples, lists, sets, frozensets and "
"dictionaries are only supported as long as the values contained therein are "
"themselves supported.  The singletons :const:`None`, :const:`Ellipsis` and :"
"exc:`StopIteration` can also be marshalled and unmarshalled. For format "
"*version* lower than 3, recursive lists, sets and dictionaries cannot be "
"written (see below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are functions that read/write files as well as functions operating on "
"bytes-like objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "The module defines these functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Write the value on the open file.  The value must be a supported type.  The "
"file must be a writeable :term:`binary file`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the value has (or contains an object that has) an unsupported type, a :"
"exc:`ValueError` exception is raised --- but garbage data will also be "
"written to the file.  The object will not be properly read back by :func:"
"`load`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *version* argument indicates the data format that ``dump`` should use "
"(see below)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``marshal.dumps`` with arguments "
"``value``, ``version``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Read one value from the open file and return it.  If no valid value is read "
"(e.g. because the data has a different Python version's incompatible marshal "
"format), raise :exc:`EOFError`, :exc:`ValueError` or :exc:`TypeError`.  The "
"file must be a readable :term:`binary file`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``marshal.load`` with no "
"arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an object containing an unsupported type was marshalled with :func:"
"`dump`, :func:`load` will substitute ``None`` for the unmarshallable type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This call used to raise a ``code.__new__`` audit event for each code object. "
"Now it raises a single ``marshal.load`` event for the entire load operation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the bytes object that would be written to a file by ``dump(value, "
"file)``.  The value must be a supported type.  Raise a :exc:`ValueError` "
"exception if value has (or contains an object that has) an unsupported type."

msgid ""
"The *version* argument indicates the data format that ``dumps`` should use "

"Convert the :term:`bytes-like object` to a value.  If no valid value is "
"found, raise :exc:`EOFError`, :exc:`ValueError` or :exc:`TypeError`.  Extra "
"bytes in the input are ignored."

"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``marshal.loads`` with argument "
"``bytes``."

msgid ""
"Indicates the format that the module uses. Version 0 is the historical "
"format, version 1 shares interned strings and version 2 uses a binary format "
"for floating point numbers. Version 3 adds support for object instancing and "
"recursion. The current version is 4."

"The name of this module stems from a bit of terminology used by the "
"designers of Modula-3 (amongst others), who use the term \"marshalling\" for "
"shipping of data around in a self-contained form. Strictly speaking, \"to "
"marshal\" means to convert some data from internal to external form (in an "
"RPC buffer for instance) and \"unmarshalling\" for the reverse process."
