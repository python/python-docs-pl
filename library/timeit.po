msgid ":mod:`!timeit` --- Measure execution time of small code snippets"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/timeit.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides a simple way to time small bits of Python code. It has "
"both a :ref:`timeit-command-line-interface` as well as a :ref:`callable "
"<python-interface>` one.  It avoids a number of common traps for measuring "
"execution times. See also Tim Peters' introduction to the \"Algorithms\" "
"chapter in the second edition of *Python Cookbook*, published by O'Reilly."
msgstr ""

msgid "Basic Examples"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following example shows how the :ref:`timeit-command-line-interface` can "
"be used to compare three different expressions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"$ python -m timeit \"'-'.join(str(n) for n in range(100))\"\n"
"10000 loops, best of 5: 30.2 usec per loop\n"
"$ python -m timeit \"'-'.join([str(n) for n in range(100)])\"\n"
"10000 loops, best of 5: 27.5 usec per loop\n"
"$ python -m timeit \"'-'.join(map(str, range(100)))\"\n"
"10000 loops, best of 5: 23.2 usec per loop"
msgstr ""

msgid "This can be achieved from the :ref:`python-interface` with::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
">>> import timeit\n"
">>> timeit.timeit('\"-\".join(str(n) for n in range(100))', number=10000)\n"
"0.3018611848820001\n"
">>> timeit.timeit('\"-\".join([str(n) for n in range(100)])', number=10000)\n"
"0.2727368790656328\n"
">>> timeit.timeit('\"-\".join(map(str, range(100)))', number=10000)\n"
"0.23702679807320237"
msgstr ""

msgid "A callable can also be passed from the :ref:`python-interface`::"

msgid ""
">>> timeit.timeit(lambda: \"-\".join(map(str, range(100))), number=10000)\n"
"0.19665591977536678"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note however that :func:`.timeit` will automatically determine the number of "
"repetitions only when the command-line interface is used.  In the :ref:"
"`timeit-examples` section you can find more advanced examples."
msgstr ""

msgid "Python Interface"
msgstr ""

msgid "The module defines three convenience functions and a public class:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a :class:`Timer` instance with the given statement, *setup* code and "
"*timer* function and run its :meth:`.timeit` method with *number* "
"executions. The optional *globals* argument specifies a namespace in which "
"to execute the code."
msgstr ""

msgid "The optional *globals* parameter was added."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a :class:`Timer` instance with the given statement, *setup* code and "
"*timer* function and run its :meth:`.repeat` method with the given *repeat* "
"count and *number* executions.  The optional *globals* argument specifies a "
"namespace in which to execute the code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Default value of *repeat* changed from 3 to 5."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default timer, which is always time.perf_counter(), returns float "
"seconds. An alternative, time.perf_counter_ns, returns integer nanoseconds."
msgstr ""

msgid ":func:`time.perf_counter` is now the default timer."
msgstr ""

msgid "Class for timing execution speed of small code snippets."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The constructor takes a statement to be timed, an additional statement used "
"for setup, and a timer function.  Both statements default to ``'pass'``; the "
"timer function is platform-dependent (see the module doc string). *stmt* and "
"*setup* may also contain multiple statements separated by ``;`` or newlines, "
"as long as they don't contain multi-line string literals.  The statement "
"will by default be executed within timeit's namespace; this behavior can be "
"controlled by passing a namespace to *globals*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To measure the execution time of the first statement, use the :meth:`."
"timeit` method.  The :meth:`.repeat` and :meth:`.autorange` methods are "
"convenience methods to call :meth:`.timeit` multiple times."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The execution time of *setup* is excluded from the overall timed execution "
"run."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *stmt* and *setup* parameters can also take objects that are callable "
"without arguments.  This will embed calls to them in a timer function that "
"will then be executed by :meth:`.timeit`.  Note that the timing overhead is "
"a little larger in this case because of the extra function calls."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Time *number* executions of the main statement.  This executes the setup "
"statement once, and then returns the time it takes to execute the main "
"statement a number of times.  The default timer returns seconds as a float. "
"The argument is the number of times through the loop, defaulting to one "
"million.  The main statement, the setup statement and the timer function to "
"be used are passed to the constructor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, :meth:`.timeit` temporarily turns off :term:`garbage collection` "
"during the timing.  The advantage of this approach is that it makes "
"independent timings more comparable.  The disadvantage is that GC may be an "
"important component of the performance of the function being measured.  If "
"so, GC can be re-enabled as the first statement in the *setup* string.  For "
"example::"
msgstr ""

msgid "timeit.Timer('for i in range(10): oct(i)', 'gc.enable()').timeit()"
msgstr ""

msgid "Automatically determine how many times to call :meth:`.timeit`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a convenience function that calls :meth:`.timeit` repeatedly so that "
"the total time >= 0.2 second, returning the eventual (number of loops, time "
"taken for that number of loops). It calls :meth:`.timeit` with increasing "
"numbers from the sequence 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, ... until the time taken is "
"at least 0.2 seconds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *callback* is given and is not ``None``, it will be called after each "
"trial with two arguments: ``callback(number, time_taken)``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Call :meth:`.timeit` a few times."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a convenience function that calls the :meth:`.timeit` repeatedly, "
"returning a list of results.  The first argument specifies how many times to "
"call :meth:`.timeit`.  The second argument specifies the *number* argument "
"for :meth:`.timeit`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It's tempting to calculate mean and standard deviation from the result "
"vector and report these.  However, this is not very useful. In a typical "
"case, the lowest value gives a lower bound for how fast your machine can run "
"the given code snippet; higher values in the result vector are typically not "
"caused by variability in Python's speed, but by other processes interfering "
"with your timing accuracy. So the :func:`min` of the result is probably the "
"only number you should be interested in.  After that, you should look at the "
"entire vector and apply common sense rather than statistics."
msgstr ""

msgid "Helper to print a traceback from the timed code."
msgstr ""

msgid "Typical use::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"t = Timer(...)       # outside the try/except\n"
"try:\n"
"    t.timeit(...)    # or t.repeat(...)\n"
"except Exception:\n"
"    t.print_exc()"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The advantage over the standard traceback is that source lines in the "
"compiled template will be displayed.  The optional *file* argument directs "
"where the traceback is sent; it defaults to :data:`sys.stderr`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Command-Line Interface"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When called as a program from the command line, the following form is used::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"python -m timeit [-n N] [-r N] [-u U] [-s S] [-p] [-v] [-h] [statement ...]"
msgstr ""

msgid "Where the following options are understood:"
msgstr ""

msgid "how many times to execute 'statement'"
msgstr ""

msgid "how many times to repeat the timer (default 5)"
msgstr ""

msgid "statement to be executed once initially (default ``pass``)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"measure process time, not wallclock time, using :func:`time.process_time` "
"instead of :func:`time.perf_counter`, which is the default"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"specify a time unit for timer output; can select ``nsec``, ``usec``, "
"``msec``, or ``sec``"
msgstr ""

msgid "print raw timing results; repeat for more digits precision"
msgstr ""

msgid "print a short usage message and exit"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A multi-line statement may be given by specifying each line as a separate "
"statement argument; indented lines are possible by enclosing an argument in "
"quotes and using leading spaces.  Multiple :option:`-s` options are treated "
"similarly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If :option:`-n` is not given, a suitable number of loops is calculated by "
"trying increasing numbers from the sequence 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, ... until "
"the total time is at least 0.2 seconds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`default_timer` measurements can be affected by other programs running "
"on the same machine, so the best thing to do when accurate timing is "
"necessary is to repeat the timing a few times and use the best time.  The :"
"option:`-r` option is good for this; the default of 5 repetitions is "
"probably enough in most cases.  You can use :func:`time.process_time` to "
"measure CPU time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is a certain baseline overhead associated with executing a pass "
"statement. The code here doesn't try to hide it, but you should be aware of "
"it.  The baseline overhead can be measured by invoking the program without "
"arguments, and it might differ between Python versions."
