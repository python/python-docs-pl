msgid ""
"The module :mod:`xml.sax.saxutils` contains a number of classes and "
"functions that are commonly useful when creating SAX applications, either in "
"direct use, or as base classes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Escape ``'&'``, ``'<'``, and ``'>'`` in a string of data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can escape other strings of data by passing a dictionary as the optional "
"*entities* parameter.  The keys and values must all be strings; each key "
"will be replaced with its corresponding value.  The characters ``'&'``, "
"``'<'`` and ``'>'`` are always escaped, even if *entities* is provided."
msgstr ""

msgid "Unescape ``'&amp;'``, ``'&lt;'``, and ``'&gt;'`` in a string of data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can unescape other strings of data by passing a dictionary as the "
"optional *entities* parameter.  The keys and values must all be strings; "
"each key will be replaced with its corresponding value.  ``'&amp'``, "
"``'&lt;'``, and ``'&gt;'`` are always unescaped, even if *entities* is "
"provided."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar to :func:`escape`, but also prepares *data* to be used as an "
"attribute value.  The return value is a quoted version of *data* with any "
"additional required replacements. :func:`quoteattr` will select a quote "
"character based on the content of *data*, attempting to avoid encoding any "
"quote characters in the string.  If both single- and double-quote characters "
"are already in *data*, the double-quote characters will be encoded and "
"*data* will be wrapped in double-quotes.  The resulting string can be used "
"directly as an attribute value::"

msgid ""
"This function is useful when generating attribute values for HTML or any "
"SGML using the reference concrete syntax."

msgid ""
"This class implements the :class:`~xml.sax.handler.ContentHandler` interface "
"by writing SAX events back into an XML document. In other words, using an :"
"class:`XMLGenerator` as the content handler will reproduce the original "
"document being parsed. *out* should be a file-like object which will default "
"to *sys.stdout*. *encoding* is the encoding of the output stream which "
"defaults to ``'iso-8859-1'``. *short_empty_elements* controls the formatting "
"of elements that contain no content:  if ``False`` (the default) they are "
"emitted as a pair of start/end tags, if set to ``True`` they are emitted as "
"a single self-closed tag."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *short_empty_elements* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This class is designed to sit between an :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader."
"XMLReader` and the client application's event handlers.  By default, it does "
"nothing but pass requests up to the reader and events on to the handlers "
"unmodified, but subclasses can override specific methods to modify the event "
"stream or the configuration requests as they pass through."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function takes an input source and an optional base URL and returns a "
"fully resolved :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource` object ready for "
"reading.  The input source can be given as a string, a file-like object, or "
"an :class:`~xml.sax.xmlreader.InputSource` object; parsers will use this "
"function to implement the polymorphic *source* argument to their :meth:"
"`parse` method."
