"The :mod:`telnetlib` module provides a :class:`Telnet` class that implements "
"the Telnet protocol.  See :rfc:`854` for details about the protocol. In "
"addition, it provides symbolic constants for the protocol characters (see "
"below), and for the telnet options. The symbolic names of the telnet options "
"follow the definitions in ``arpa/telnet.h``, with the leading ``TELOPT_`` "
"removed. For symbolic names of options which are traditionally not included "
"in ``arpa/telnet.h``, see the module source itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The symbolic constants for the telnet commands are: IAC, DONT, DO, WONT, "
"WILL, SE (Subnegotiation End), NOP (No Operation), DM (Data Mark), BRK "
"(Break), IP (Interrupt process), AO (Abort output), AYT (Are You There), EC "

":class:`Telnet` represents a connection to a Telnet server. The instance is "
"initially not connected by default; the :meth:`~Telnet.open` method must be "
"used to establish a connection.  Alternatively, the host name and optional "
"port number can be passed to the constructor too, in which case the "
"connection to the server will be established before the constructor "
"returns.  The optional *timeout* parameter specifies a timeout in seconds "
"for blocking operations like the connection attempt (if not specified, the "
"global default timeout setting will be used)."

msgid ""
"Connect to a host. The optional second argument is the port number, which "
