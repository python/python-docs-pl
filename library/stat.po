msgid ":mod:`stat` --- Interpreting :func:`~os.stat` results"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/stat.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`stat` module defines constants and functions for interpreting the "
"results of :func:`os.stat`, :func:`os.fstat` and :func:`os.lstat` (if they "
"exist).  For complete details about the :c:func:`stat`, :c:func:`fstat` and :"
"c:func:`lstat` calls, consult the documentation for your system."
msgstr ""

msgid "The stat module is backed by a C implementation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`stat` module defines the following functions to test for specific "
"file types:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a directory."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a character special device file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a block special device file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a regular file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a FIFO (named pipe)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a symbolic link."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a socket."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a door."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from an event port."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return non-zero if the mode is from a whiteout."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Two additional functions are defined for more general manipulation of the "
"file's mode:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the portion of the file's mode that can be set by :func:`os.chmod`\\ "
"---that is, the file's permission bits, plus the sticky bit, set-group-id, "
"and set-user-id bits (on systems that support them)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the portion of the file's mode that describes the file type (used by "
"the :func:`S_IS\\*` functions above)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normally, you would use the :func:`os.path.is\\*` functions for testing the "
"type of a file; the functions here are useful when you are doing multiple "
"tests of the same file and wish to avoid the overhead of the :c:func:`stat` "
"system call for each test.  These are also useful when checking for "
"information about a file that isn't handled by :mod:`os.path`, like the "
"tests for block and character devices."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An additional utility function is provided to convert a file's mode in a "
"human readable string:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Convert a file's mode to a string of the form '-rwxrwxrwx'."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function supports :data:`S_IFDOOR`, :data:`S_IFPORT` and :data:`S_IFWHT`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All the variables below are simply symbolic indexes into the 10-tuple "
"returned by :func:`os.stat`, :func:`os.fstat` or :func:`os.lstat`."

"Size in bytes of a plain file; amount of data waiting on some special files."
msgstr ""

msgid "Time of last access."
msgstr ""

msgid "Time of last modification."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The \"ctime\" as reported by the operating system.  On some systems (like "
"Unix) is the time of the last metadata change, and, on others (like "
"Windows), is the creation time (see platform documentation for details)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The interpretation of \"file size\" changes according to the file type.  For "
"plain files this is the size of the file in bytes.  For FIFOs and sockets "
"under most flavors of Unix (including Linux in particular), the \"size\" is "
"the number of bytes waiting to be read at the time of the call to :func:`os."
"stat`, :func:`os.fstat`, or :func:`os.lstat`; this can sometimes be useful, "
"especially for polling one of these special files after a non-blocking "
"open.  The meaning of the size field for other character and block devices "
"varies more, depending on the implementation of the underlying system call."

"Set-group-ID bit.  This bit has several special uses.  For a directory it "
"indicates that BSD semantics is to be used for that directory: files created "
"there inherit their group ID from the directory, not from the effective "
"group ID of the creating process, and directories created there will also "
"get the :data:`S_ISGID` bit set.  For a file that does not have the group "
"execution bit (:data:`S_IXGRP`) set, the set-group-ID bit indicates "
"mandatory file/record locking (see also :data:`S_ENFMT`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
