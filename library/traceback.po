msgid ":mod:`traceback` --- Print or retrieve a stack traceback"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/traceback.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides a standard interface to extract, format and print stack "
"traces of Python programs.  It exactly mimics the behavior of the Python "
"interpreter when it prints a stack trace.  This is useful when you want to "
"print stack traces under program control, such as in a \"wrapper\" around "
"the interpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module uses :ref:`traceback objects <traceback-objects>` --- these are "
"objects of type :class:`types.TracebackType`, which are assigned to the :"
"attr:`~BaseException.__traceback__` field of :class:`BaseException` "
"instances."
msgstr ""

msgid "Module :mod:`faulthandler`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Used to dump Python tracebacks explicitly, on a fault, after a timeout, or "
"on a user signal."
msgstr ""

msgid "Module :mod:`pdb`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Interactive source code debugger for Python programs."
msgstr ""

msgid "The module defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Print up to *limit* stack trace entries from :ref:`traceback object "
"<traceback-objects>` *tb* (starting from the caller's frame) if *limit* is "
"positive.  Otherwise, print the last ``abs(limit)`` entries.  If *limit* is "
"omitted or ``None``, all entries are printed.  If *file* is omitted or "
"``None``, the output goes to :data:`sys.stderr`; otherwise it should be an "
"open :term:`file <file object>` or :term:`file-like object` to receive the "
"output."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added negative *limit* support."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Print exception information and stack trace entries from :ref:`traceback "
"object <traceback-objects>` *tb* to *file*. This differs from :func:"
"`print_tb` in the following ways:"

msgid ""
"if *tb* is not ``None``, it prints a header ``Traceback (most recent call "

msgstr ""

msgid "it prints the exception type and *value* after the stack trace"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"if *type(value)* is :exc:`SyntaxError` and *value* has the appropriate "
"format, it prints the line where the syntax error occurred with a caret "
"indicating the approximate position of the error."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since Python 3.10, instead of passing *value* and *tb*, an exception object "
"can be passed as the first argument. If *value* and *tb* are provided, the "
"first argument is ignored in order to provide backwards compatibility."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The optional *limit* argument has the same meaning as for :func:`print_tb`. "
"If *chain* is true (the default), then chained exceptions (the :attr:"
"`~BaseException.__cause__` or :attr:`~BaseException.__context__` attributes "
"of the exception) will be printed as well, like the interpreter itself does "
"when printing an unhandled exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a shorthand for ``print_exception(sys.last_type, sys.last_value, sys."

"Print up to *limit* stack trace entries (starting from the invocation point) "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that when locals are captured, they are also shown in the traceback."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*max_group_width* and *max_group_depth* control the formatting of exception "
"groups (see :exc:`BaseExceptionGroup`). The depth refers to the nesting "
"level of the group, and the width refers to the size of a single exception "
"group's exceptions array. The formatted output is truncated when either "
"limit is exceeded."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *compact* parameter."

"__context__`."

"The :attr:`~BaseException.__suppress_context__` value from the original "

msgid "For syntax errors - the file name where the error occurred."

"display detailed information about where the syntax error occurred."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The exception's :attr:`notes <BaseException.__notes__>` are now included in "
"the output."
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`!StackSummary` Objects"

"*lookup_lines* is ``False``, the returned :class:`FrameSummary` objects will "

"StackSummary` cheaper (which may be valuable if it may not actually get "

"class:`!FrameSummary` are captured as object representations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Construct a :class:`!StackSummary` object from a supplied list of :class:"

"4-tuple with *filename*, *lineno*, *name*, *line* as the elements."
msgstr ""
