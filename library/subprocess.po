msgid "Using the :mod:`subprocess` Module"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The recommended approach to invoking subprocesses is to use the :func:`run` "
"function for all use cases it can handle. For more advanced use cases, the "
"underlying :class:`Popen` interface can be used directly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Run the command described by *args*.  Wait for command to complete, then "
"return a :class:`CompletedProcess` instance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The arguments shown above are merely the most common ones, described below "
"in :ref:`frequently-used-arguments` (hence the use of keyword-only notation "
"in the abbreviated signature). The full function signature is largely the "
"same as that of the :class:`Popen` constructor - most of the arguments to "
"this function are passed through to that interface. (*timeout*,  *input*, "
"*check*, and *capture_output* are not.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *capture_output* is true, stdout and stderr will be captured. When used, "
"the internal :class:`Popen` object is automatically created with "
"``stdout=PIPE`` and ``stderr=PIPE``. The *stdout* and *stderr* arguments may "
"not be supplied at the same time as *capture_output*.  If you wish to "
"capture and combine both streams into one, use ``stdout=PIPE`` and "
"``stderr=STDOUT`` instead of *capture_output*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *timeout* argument is passed to :meth:`Popen.communicate`. If the "
"timeout expires, the child process will be killed and waited for.  The :exc:"
"`TimeoutExpired` exception will be re-raised after the child process has "
"terminated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *input* argument is passed to :meth:`Popen.communicate` and thus to the "

"To support a wide variety of use cases, the :class:`Popen` constructor (and "
"the convenience functions) accept a large number of optional arguments. For "
"most typical use cases, many of these arguments can be safely left at their "
"default values. The arguments that are most commonly needed are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*args* is required for all calls and should be a string, or a sequence of "
"program arguments. Providing a sequence of arguments is generally preferred, "
"as it allows the module to take care of any required escaping and quoting of "
"arguments (e.g. to permit spaces in file names). If passing a single string, "
"either *shell* must be :const:`True` (see below) or else the string must "
"simply name the program to be executed without specifying any arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*stdin*, *stdout* and *stderr* specify the executed program's standard "
"input, standard output and standard error file handles, respectively.  Valid "
"values are :data:`PIPE`, :data:`DEVNULL`, an existing file descriptor (a "
"positive integer), an existing file object with a valid file descriptor, and "
"``None``. :data:`PIPE` indicates that a new pipe to the child should be "
"created. :data:`DEVNULL` indicates that the special file :data:`os.devnull` "
"will be used.  With the default settings of ``None``, no redirection will "
"occur; the child's file handles will be inherited from the parent. "
"Additionally, *stderr* can be :data:`STDOUT`, which indicates that the "
"stderr data from the child process should be captured into the same file "
"handle as for *stdout*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *encoding* or *errors* are specified, or *text* (also known as "
"*universal_newlines*) is true, the file objects *stdin*, *stdout* and "
"*stderr* will be opened in text mode using the *encoding* and *errors* "
"specified in the call or the defaults for :class:`io.TextIOWrapper`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For *stdin*, line ending characters ``'\\n'`` in the input will be converted "
"to the default line separator :data:`os.linesep`. For *stdout* and *stderr*, "
"all line endings in the output will be converted to ``'\\n'``.  For more "
"information see the documentation of the :class:`io.TextIOWrapper` class "
"when the *newline* argument to its constructor is ``None``."

msgid ""
"If *shell* is ``True``, the specified command will be executed through the "
"shell.  This can be useful if you are using Python primarily for the "
"enhanced control flow it offers over most system shells and still want "
"convenient access to other shell features such as shell pipes, filename "
"wildcards, environment variable expansion, and expansion of ``~`` to a "
"user's home directory.  However, note that Python itself offers "
"implementations of many shell-like features (in particular, :mod:`glob`, :"
"mod:`fnmatch`, :func:`os.walk`, :func:`os.path.expandvars`, :func:`os.path."
"expanduser`, and :mod:`shutil`)."

msgid ""
"When *universal_newlines* is ``True``, the class uses the encoding :func:"
"`locale.getpreferredencoding(False) <locale.getpreferredencoding>` instead "
"of ``locale.getpreferredencoding()``.  See the :class:`io.TextIOWrapper` "
"class for more information on this change."
msgstr ""

"The underlying process creation and management in this module is handled by "

"Execute a child program in a new process.  On POSIX, the class uses :meth:"
"`os.execvpe`-like behavior to execute the child program.  On Windows, the "

"class:`Popen` are as follows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*args* should be a sequence of program arguments or else a single string or :"
"term:`path-like object`. By default, the program to execute is the first "
"item in *args* if *args* is a sequence.  If *args* is a string, the "
"interpretation is platform-dependent and described below.  See the *shell* "
"and *executable* arguments for additional differences from the default "
"behavior.  Unless otherwise stated, it is recommended to pass *args* as a "
"sequence."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For maximum reliability, use a fully qualified path for the executable. To "
"search for an unqualified name on :envvar:`PATH`, use :meth:`shutil.which`. "
"On all platforms, passing :data:`sys.executable` is the recommended way to "
"launch the current Python interpreter again, and use the ``-m`` command-line "
"format to launch an installed module."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Resolving the path of *executable* (or the first item of *args*) is platform "
"dependent. For POSIX, see :meth:`os.execvpe`, and note that when resolving "
"or searching for the executable path, *cwd* overrides the current working "
"directory and *env* can override the ``PATH`` environment variable. For "
"Windows, see the documentation of the ``lpApplicationName`` and "
"``lpCommandLine`` parameters of WinAPI ``CreateProcess``, and note that when "
"resolving or searching for the executable path with ``shell=False``, *cwd* "
"does not override the current working directory and *env* cannot override "
"the ``PATH`` environment variable. Using a full path avoids all of these "
"variations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An example of passing some arguments to an external program as a sequence "
"is::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On POSIX, if *args* is a string, the string is interpreted as the name or "
"path of the program to execute.  However, this can only be done if not "
"passing arguments to the program."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It may not be obvious how to break a shell command into a sequence of "
"arguments, especially in complex cases. :meth:`shlex.split` can illustrate "
"how to determine the correct tokenization for *args*::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note in particular that options (such as *-input*) and arguments (such as "
"*eggs.txt*) that are separated by whitespace in the shell go in separate "
"list elements, while arguments that need quoting or backslash escaping when "
"used in the shell (such as filenames containing spaces or the *echo* command "
"shown above) are single list elements."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, if *args* is a sequence, it will be converted to a string in a "
"manner described in :ref:`converting-argument-sequence`.  This is because "
"the underlying ``CreateProcess()`` operates on strings."

msgid ""
"*args* parameter accepts a :term:`path-like object` if *shell* is ``False`` "
"and a sequence containing bytes and path-like objects on Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *shell* argument (which defaults to ``False``) specifies whether to use "
"the shell as the program to execute.  If *shell* is ``True``, it is "
"recommended to pass *args* as a string rather than as a sequence."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On POSIX with ``shell=True``, the shell defaults to :file:`/bin/sh`.  If "
"*args* is a string, the string specifies the command to execute through the "
"shell.  This means that the string must be formatted exactly as it would be "
"when typed at the shell prompt.  This includes, for example, quoting or "
"backslash escaping filenames with spaces in them.  If *args* is a sequence, "
"the first item specifies the command string, and any additional items will "
"be treated as additional arguments to the shell itself.  That is to say, :"
"class:`Popen` does the equivalent of::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows with ``shell=True``, the :envvar:`COMSPEC` environment variable "
"specifies the default shell.  The only time you need to specify "
"``shell=True`` on Windows is when the command you wish to execute is built "
"into the shell (e.g. :command:`dir` or :command:`copy`).  You do not need "
"``shell=True`` to run a batch file or console-based executable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*bufsize* will be supplied as the corresponding argument to the :func:`open` "
"function when creating the stdin/stdout/stderr pipe file objects:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":const:`0` means unbuffered (read and write are one system call and can "
"return short)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":const:`1` means line buffered (only usable if ``text=True`` or "
"``universal_newlines=True``)"
msgstr ""

msgid "any other positive value means use a buffer of approximately that size"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"negative bufsize (the default) means the system default of io."
"DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE will be used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*bufsize* now defaults to -1 to enable buffering by default to match the "
"behavior that most code expects.  In versions prior to Python 3.2.4 and "
"3.3.1 it incorrectly defaulted to :const:`0` which was unbuffered and "
"allowed short reads.  This was unintentional and did not match the behavior "
"of Python 2 as most code expected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *executable* argument specifies a replacement program to execute.   It "
"is very seldom needed.  When ``shell=False``, *executable* replaces the "
"program to execute specified by *args*.  However, the original *args* is "
"still passed to the program.  Most programs treat the program specified by "
"*args* as the command name, which can then be different from the program "
"actually executed.  On POSIX, the *args* name becomes the display name for "
"the executable in utilities such as :program:`ps`.  If ``shell=True``, on "
