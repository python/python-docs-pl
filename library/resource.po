msgid ":mod:`resource` --- Resource usage information"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides basic mechanisms for measuring and controlling system "
"resources utilized by a program."
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`Availability <availability>`: not Emscripten, not WASI."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly platforms "
"``wasm32-emscripten`` and ``wasm32-wasi``. See :ref:`wasm-availability` for "
"more information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Symbolic constants are used to specify particular system resources and to "
"request usage information about either the current process or its children."
msgstr ""

msgid "An :exc:`OSError` is raised on syscall failure."
msgstr ""

msgid "A deprecated alias of :exc:`OSError`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Following :pep:`3151`, this class was made an alias of :exc:`OSError`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Resource Limits"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Resources usage can be limited using the :func:`setrlimit` function "
"described below. Each resource is controlled by a pair of limits: a soft "
"limit and a hard limit. The soft limit is the current limit, and may be "
"lowered or raised by a process over time. The soft limit can never exceed "
"the hard limit. The hard limit can be lowered to any value greater than the "
"soft limit, but not raised. (Only processes with the effective UID of the "
"super-user can raise a hard limit.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The specific resources that can be limited are system dependent. They are "
"described in the :manpage:`getrlimit(2)` man page.  The resources listed "
"below are supported when the underlying operating system supports them; "
"resources which cannot be checked or controlled by the operating system are "
"not defined in this module for those platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid "Constant used to represent the limit for an unlimited resource."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a tuple ``(soft, hard)`` with the current soft and hard limits of "
"*resource*. Raises :exc:`ValueError` if an invalid resource is specified, "
"or :exc:`error` if the underlying system call fails unexpectedly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sets new limits of consumption of *resource*. The *limits* argument must be "
"a tuple ``(soft, hard)`` of two integers describing the new limits. A value "
"of :data:`~resource.RLIM_INFINITY` can be used to request a limit that is "
"unlimited."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises :exc:`ValueError` if an invalid resource is specified, if the new "
"soft limit exceeds the hard limit, or if a process tries to raise its hard "
"limit. Specifying a limit of :data:`~resource.RLIM_INFINITY` when the hard "
"or system limit for that resource is not unlimited will result in a :exc:"
"`ValueError`.  A process with the effective UID of super-user can request "
"any valid limit value, including unlimited, but :exc:`ValueError` will still "
"be raised if the requested limit exceeds the system imposed limit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``setrlimit`` may also raise :exc:`error` if the underlying system call "
"fails."
msgstr ""

msgid "VxWorks only supports setting :data:`RLIMIT_NOFILE`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``resource.setrlimit`` with "
"arguments ``resource``, ``limits``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Combines :func:`setrlimit` and :func:`getrlimit` in one function and "
"supports to get and set the resources limits of an arbitrary process. If "
"*pid* is 0, then the call applies to the current process. *resource* and "
"*limits* have the same meaning as in :func:`setrlimit`, except that *limits* "
"is optional."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When *limits* is not given the function returns the *resource* limit of the "
"process *pid*. When *limits* is given the *resource* limit of the process is "
"set and the former resource limit is returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises :exc:`ProcessLookupError` when *pid* can't be found and :exc:"
"`PermissionError` when the user doesn't have ``CAP_SYS_RESOURCE`` for the "
"process."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``resource.prlimit`` with "
"arguments ``pid``, ``resource``, ``limits``."

"These symbols define resources whose consumption can be controlled using "
"the :func:`setrlimit` and :func:`getrlimit` functions described below. The "
"values of these symbols are exactly the constants used by C programs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

"same resource.  This module does not attempt to mask platform differences "
"--- symbols not defined for a platform will not be available from this "
