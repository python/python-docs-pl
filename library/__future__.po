msgid ":mod:`__future__` is a real module, and serves three purposes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To avoid confusing existing tools that analyze import statements and expect "
"to find the modules they're importing."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To ensure that :ref:`future statements <future>` run under releases prior to "
"2.1 at least yield runtime exceptions (the import of :mod:`__future__` will "
"fail, because there was no module of that name prior to 2.1)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To document when incompatible changes were introduced, and when they will be "
"--- or were --- made mandatory.  This is a form of executable documentation, "
"and can be inspected programmatically via importing :mod:`__future__` and "
"examining its contents."
msgstr ""

msgid "Each statement in :file:`__future__.py` is of the form::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"where, normally, *OptionalRelease* is less than *MandatoryRelease*, and both "
"are 5-tuples of the same form as :data:`sys.version_info`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*OptionalRelease* records the first release in which the feature was "
"accepted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the case of a *MandatoryRelease* that has not yet occurred, "
"*MandatoryRelease* predicts the release in which the feature will become "
"part of the language."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Else *MandatoryRelease* records when the feature became part of the "
"language; in releases at or after that, modules no longer need a future "
"statement to use the feature in question, but may continue to use such "
"imports."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*MandatoryRelease* may also be ``None``, meaning that a planned feature got "
"dropped."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instances of class :class:`_Feature` have two corresponding methods, :meth:"
"`getOptionalRelease` and :meth:`getMandatoryRelease`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*CompilerFlag* is the (bitfield) flag that should be passed in the fourth "
"argument to the built-in function :func:`compile` to enable the feature in "
"dynamically compiled code.  This flag is stored in the :attr:`compiler_flag` "
"attribute on :class:`_Feature` instances."

msgid ""
"No feature description will ever be deleted from :mod:`__future__`. Since "
"its introduction in Python 2.1 the following features have found their way "
"into the language using this mechanism:"
