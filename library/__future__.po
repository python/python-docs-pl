"Imports of the form ``from __future__ import feature`` are called :ref:"

"statement before the release in which the feature becomes standard."

"While these future statements are given additional special meaning by the "
"Python compiler, they are still executed like any other import statement and "
"the :mod:`__future__` exists and is handled by the import system the same "
"way any other Python module would be. This design serves three purposes:"
