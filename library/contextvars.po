msgid ":mod:`contextvars` --- Context Variables"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides APIs to manage, store, and access context-local state.  "
"The :class:`~contextvars.ContextVar` class is used to declare and work with "
"*Context Variables*.  The :func:`~contextvars.copy_context` function and "
"the :class:`~contextvars.Context` class should be used to manage the current "
"context in asynchronous frameworks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Context managers that have state should use Context Variables instead of :"
"func:`threading.local()` to prevent their state from bleeding to other code "
"unexpectedly, when used in concurrent code."
msgstr ""

msgid "See also :pep:`567` for additional details."

"The required *name* parameter is used for introspection and debug purposes."

msgid ""
"The optional keyword-only *default* parameter is returned by :meth:"
"`ContextVar.get` when no value for the variable is found in the current "
"context."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Important:** Context Variables should be created at the top module level "
"and never in closures.  :class:`Context` objects hold strong references to "
"context variables which prevents context variables from being properly "
"garbage collected."

"*Token* objects are returned by the :meth:`ContextVar.set` method. They can "

"The function has an O(1) complexity, i.e. works equally fast for contexts "

msgstr ""

msgid "A mapping of :class:`ContextVars <ContextVar>` to their values."

msgid ""
"``Context()`` creates an empty context with no values in it. To get a copy "
"of the current context use the :func:`~contextvars.copy_context` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every thread will have a different top-level :class:`~contextvars.Context` "
"object. This means that a :class:`ContextVar` object behaves in a similar "
"fashion to :func:`threading.local()` when values are assigned in different "
"threads."

"Execute ``callable(*args, **kwargs)`` code in the context object the *run* "

"Any changes to any context variables that *callable* makes will be contained "
