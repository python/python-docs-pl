msgid ""
":mod:`dbm` is a generic interface to variants of the DBM database --- :mod:"

msgid ""
"Returns one of the following values: ``None`` if the file can't be opened "

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/dbm/gnu.py`"

msgid ""
"This module is quite similar to the :mod:`dbm` module, but uses the GNU "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`dbm.gnu` module provides an interface to the GNU DBM library. "

"It's possible to loop over every key in the database using this method  and "
"the :meth:`nextkey` method.  The traversal is ordered by ``gdbm``'s internal "

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/dbm/ndbm.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`dbm.ndbm` module provides an interface to the Unix \"(n)dbm\" "

"The :mod:`dbm.dumb` module is intended as a last resort fallback for the :"

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`dbm.dumb` module provides a persistent dictionary-like interface "
