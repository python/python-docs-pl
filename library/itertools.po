msgid ":mod:`itertools` --- Functions creating iterators for efficient looping"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module implements a number of :term:`iterator` building blocks inspired "
"by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML.  Each has been recast in a form "
"suitable for Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are "
"useful by themselves or in combination.  Together, they form an \"iterator "
"algebra\" making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and "
"efficiently in pure Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For instance, SML provides a tabulation tool: ``tabulate(f)`` which produces "
"a sequence ``f(0), f(1), ...``.  The same effect can be achieved in Python "
"by combining :func:`map` and :func:`count` to form ``map(f, count())``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These tools and their built-in counterparts also work well with the high-"
"speed functions in the :mod:`operator` module.  For example, the "
"multiplication operator can be mapped across two vectors to form an "
"efficient dot-product: ``sum(starmap(operator.mul, zip(vec1, vec2, "
"strict=True)))``."

msgid "Itertool functions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following module functions all construct and return iterators. Some "
"provide streams of infinite length, so they should only be accessed by "
"functions or loops that truncate the stream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make an iterator that returns accumulated sums, or accumulated results of "
"other binary functions (specified via the optional *func* argument)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *func* is supplied, it should be a function of two arguments. Elements of "
"the input *iterable* may be any type that can be accepted as arguments to "
"*func*. (For example, with the default operation of addition, elements may "
"be any addable type including :class:`~decimal.Decimal` or :class:"
"`~fractions.Fraction`.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Usually, the number of elements output matches the input iterable. However, "
"if the keyword argument *initial* is provided, the accumulation leads off "
"with the *initial* value so that the output has one more element than the "
"input iterable."
msgstr ""

msgid "Roughly equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are a number of uses for the *func* argument.  It can be set to :func:"
"`min` for a running minimum, :func:`max` for a running maximum, or :func:"
"`operator.mul` for a running product.  Amortization tables can be built by "
"accumulating interest and applying payments:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See :func:`functools.reduce` for a similar function that returns only the "
"final accumulated value."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the optional *func* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the optional *initial* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make an iterator that returns elements from the first iterable until it is "
"exhausted, then proceeds to the next iterable, until all of the iterables "
"are exhausted.  Used for treating consecutive sequences as a single "
"sequence. Roughly equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternate constructor for :func:`chain`.  Gets chained inputs from a single "
"iterable argument that is evaluated lazily.  Roughly equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Return *r* length subsequences of elements from the input *iterable*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The combination tuples are emitted in lexicographic ordering according to "
"the order of the input *iterable*. So, if the input *iterable* is sorted, "
"the output tuples will be produced in sorted order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their value.  "
"So if the input elements are unique, there will be no repeated values in "
"each combination."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The code for :func:`combinations` can be also expressed as a subsequence of :"
"func:`permutations` after filtering entries where the elements are not in "
"sorted order (according to their position in the input pool)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The number of items returned is ``n! / r! / (n-r)!`` when ``0 <= r <= n`` or "
"zero when ``r > n``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return *r* length subsequences of elements from the input *iterable* "
"allowing individual elements to be repeated more than once."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their value.  "
"So if the input elements are unique, the generated combinations will also be "
"unique."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The code for :func:`combinations_with_replacement` can be also expressed as "
"a subsequence of :func:`product` after filtering entries where the elements "
"are not in sorted order (according to their position in the input pool)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The number of items returned is ``(n+r-1)! / r! / (n-1)!`` when ``n > 0``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make an iterator that filters elements from *data* returning only those that "
"have a corresponding element in *selectors* that evaluates to ``True``. "
"Stops when either the *data* or *selectors* iterables has been exhausted. "
"Roughly equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make an iterator that returns evenly spaced values starting with number "
"*start*. Often used as an argument to :func:`map` to generate consecutive "
"data points. Also, used with :func:`zip` to add sequence numbers.  Roughly "
"equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When counting with floating point numbers, better accuracy can sometimes be "
"achieved by substituting multiplicative code such as: ``(start + step * i "
"for i in count())``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added *step* argument and allowed non-integer arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make an iterator returning elements from the iterable and saving a copy of "
"each. When the iterable is exhausted, return elements from the saved copy.  "
"Repeats indefinitely.  Roughly equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note, this member of the toolkit may require significant auxiliary storage "
"(depending on the length of the iterable)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make an iterator that drops elements from the iterable as long as the "
"predicate is true; afterwards, returns every element.  Note, the iterator "
"does not produce *any* output until the predicate first becomes false, so it "
"may have a lengthy start-up time.  Roughly equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make an iterator that filters elements from iterable returning only those "
"for which the predicate is false. If *predicate* is ``None``, return the "
"items that are false. Roughly equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make an iterator that returns consecutive keys and groups from the "
"*iterable*. The *key* is a function computing a key value for each element.  "
"If not specified or is ``None``, *key* defaults to an identity function and "
"returns the element unchanged.  Generally, the iterable needs to already be "
"sorted on the same key function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The operation of :func:`groupby` is similar to the ``uniq`` filter in Unix.  "
"It generates a break or new group every time the value of the key function "
"changes (which is why it is usually necessary to have sorted the data using "
"the same key function).  That behavior differs from SQL's GROUP BY which "
"aggregates common elements regardless of their input order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The returned group is itself an iterator that shares the underlying iterable "
"with :func:`groupby`.  Because the source is shared, when the :func:"
"`groupby` object is advanced, the previous group is no longer visible.  So, "
"if that data is needed later, it should be stored as a list::"
msgstr ""

msgid ":func:`groupby` is roughly equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make an iterator that returns selected elements from the iterable. If "
"*start* is non-zero, then elements from the iterable are skipped until start "
"is reached. Afterward, elements are returned consecutively unless *step* is "
"set higher than one which results in items being skipped.  If *stop* is "
"``None``, then iteration continues until the iterator is exhausted, if at "
"all; otherwise, it stops at the specified position."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *start* is ``None``, then iteration starts at zero. If *step* is "
"``None``, then the step defaults to one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike regular slicing, :func:`islice` does not support negative values for "
"*start*, *stop*, or *step*.  Can be used to extract related fields from data "
"where the internal structure has been flattened (for example, a multi-line "
"report may list a name field on every third line)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return successive overlapping pairs taken from the input *iterable*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The number of 2-tuples in the output iterator will be one fewer than the "
"number of inputs.  It will be empty if the input iterable has fewer than two "
"values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return successive *r* length permutations of elements in the *iterable*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *r* is not specified or is ``None``, then *r* defaults to the length of "
"the *iterable* and all possible full-length permutations are generated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The permutation tuples are emitted in lexicographic order according to the "
"order of the input *iterable*. So, if the input *iterable* is sorted, the "
"output tuples will be produced in sorted order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their value.  "
"So if the input elements are unique, there will be no repeated values within "
"a permutation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The code for :func:`permutations` can be also expressed as a subsequence of :"
"func:`product`, filtered to exclude entries with repeated elements (those "
"from the same position in the input pool)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The number of items returned is ``n! / (n-r)!`` when ``0 <= r <= n`` or zero "
"when ``r > n``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cartesian product of input iterables."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Roughly equivalent to nested for-loops in a generator expression. For "
"example, ``product(A, B)`` returns the same as ``((x,y) for x in A for y in "
"B)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The nested loops cycle like an odometer with the rightmost element advancing "
"on every iteration.  This pattern creates a lexicographic ordering so that "
"if the input's iterables are sorted, the product tuples are emitted in "
"sorted order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To compute the product of an iterable with itself, specify the number of "
"repetitions with the optional *repeat* keyword argument.  For example, "
"``product(A, repeat=4)`` means the same as ``product(A, A, A, A)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is roughly equivalent to the following code, except that the "
"actual implementation does not build up intermediate results in memory::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Before :func:`product` runs, it completely consumes the input iterables, "
"keeping pools of values in memory to generate the products.  Accordingly, it "
"is only useful with finite inputs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make an iterator that returns *object* over and over again. Runs "
"indefinitely unless the *times* argument is specified."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common use for *repeat* is to supply a stream of constant values to *map* "
"or *zip*:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make an iterator that computes the function using arguments obtained from "
"the iterable.  Used instead of :func:`map` when argument parameters are "
"already grouped in tuples from a single iterable (when the data has been "
"\"pre-zipped\")."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The difference between :func:`map` and :func:`starmap` parallels the "
"distinction between ``function(a,b)`` and ``function(*c)``. Roughly "
"equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make an iterator that returns elements from the iterable as long as the "
"predicate is true.  Roughly equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Return *n* independent iterators from a single iterable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following Python code helps explain what *tee* does (although the actual "
"implementation is more complex and uses only a single underlying :abbr:`FIFO "
"(first-in, first-out)` queue)::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once a :func:`tee` has been created, the original *iterable* should not be "
"used anywhere else; otherwise, the *iterable* could get advanced without the "
"tee objects being informed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``tee`` iterators are not threadsafe. A :exc:`RuntimeError` may be raised "
"when using simultaneously iterators returned by the same :func:`tee` call, "
"even if the original *iterable* is threadsafe."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This itertool may require significant auxiliary storage (depending on how "
"much temporary data needs to be stored). In general, if one iterator uses "
"most or all of the data before another iterator starts, it is faster to use :"
"func:`list` instead of :func:`tee`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Make an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables. If the "
"iterables are of uneven length, missing values are filled-in with "
"*fillvalue*. Iteration continues until the longest iterable is exhausted.  "
"Roughly equivalent to::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If one of the iterables is potentially infinite, then the :func:"
"`zip_longest` function should be wrapped with something that limits the "
"number of calls (for example :func:`islice` or :func:`takewhile`).  If not "
"specified, *fillvalue* defaults to ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Itertools Recipes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This section shows recipes for creating an extended toolset using the "
"existing itertools as building blocks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The primary purpose of the itertools recipes is educational.  The recipes "
"show various ways of thinking about individual tools — for example, that "
"``chain.from_iterable`` is related to the concept of flattening.  The "
"recipes also give ideas about ways that the tools can be combined — for "
"example, how ``compress()`` and ``range()`` can work together.  The recipes "
"also show patterns for using itertools with the :mod:`operator` and :mod:"
"`collections` modules as well as with the built-in itertools such as "
"``map()``, ``filter()``, ``reversed()``, and ``enumerate()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A secondary purpose of the recipes is to serve as an incubator.  The "
"``accumulate()``, ``compress()``, and ``pairwise()`` itertools started out "
"as recipes.  Currently, the ``iter_index()`` recipe is being tested to see "
"whether it proves its worth."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Substantially all of these recipes and many, many others can be installed "
"from the `more-itertools project <https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/"
">`_ found on the Python Package Index::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many of the recipes offer the same high performance as the underlying "
"toolset. Superior memory performance is kept by processing elements one at a "
"time rather than bringing the whole iterable into memory all at once. Code "
"volume is kept small by linking the tools together in a functional style "
"which helps eliminate temporary variables.  High speed is retained by "
"preferring \"vectorized\" building blocks over the use of for-loops and :"
"term:`generator`\\s which incur interpreter overhead."
msgstr ""
