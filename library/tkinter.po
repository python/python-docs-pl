msgid "Architecture"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tcl/Tk is not a single library but rather consists of a few distinct "
"modules, each with separate functionality and its own official "
"documentation. Python's binary releases also ship an add-on module together "
"with it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tcl"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tcl is a dynamic interpreted programming language, just like Python. Though "
"it can be used on its own as a general-purpose programming language, it is "
"most commonly embedded into C applications as a scripting engine or an "
"interface to the Tk toolkit. The Tcl library has a C interface to create and "
"manage one or more instances of a Tcl interpreter, run Tcl commands and "
"scripts in those instances, and add custom commands implemented in either "
"Tcl or C. Each interpreter has an event queue, and there are facilities to "
"send events to it and process them. Unlike Python, Tcl's execution model is "
"designed around cooperative multitasking, and Tkinter bridges this "
"difference (see `Threading model`_ for details)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tk"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tk is a `Tcl package <https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/37432>`_ implemented in C "
"that adds custom commands to create and manipulate GUI widgets. Each :class:"
"`Tk` object embeds its own Tcl interpreter instance with Tk loaded into it. "
"Tk's widgets are very customizable, though at the cost of a dated "
"appearance. Tk uses Tcl's event queue to generate and process GUI events."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ttk"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Themed Tk (Ttk) is a newer family of Tk widgets that provide a much better "
"appearance on different platforms than many of the classic Tk widgets. Ttk "
"is distributed as part of Tk, starting with Tk version 8.5. Python bindings "
"are provided in a separate module, :mod:`tkinter.ttk`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Internally, Tk and Ttk use facilities of the underlying operating system, i."
"e., Xlib on Unix/X11, Cocoa on macOS, GDI on Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When your Python application uses a class in Tkinter, e.g., to create a "
"widget, the :mod:`tkinter` module first assembles a Tcl/Tk command string. "
"It passes that Tcl command string to an internal :mod:`_tkinter` binary "
"module, which then calls the Tcl interpreter to evaluate it. The Tcl "
"interpreter will then call into the Tk and/or Ttk packages, which will in "
"turn make calls to Xlib, Cocoa, or GDI."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tkinter Modules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support for Tkinter is spread across several modules. Most applications will "
"need the main :mod:`tkinter` module, as well as the :mod:`tkinter.ttk` "
"module, which provides the modern themed widget set and API::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Construct a toplevel Tk widget, which is usually the main window of an "
"application, and initialize a Tcl interpreter for this widget.  Each "
"instance has its own associated Tcl interpreter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`Tk` class is typically instantiated using all default values. "
"However, the following keyword arguments are currently recognized:"
msgstr ""

msgid "*screenName*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When given (as a string), sets the :envvar:`DISPLAY` environment variable. "
"(X11 only)"
msgstr ""

msgid "*baseName*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Name of the profile file.  By default, *baseName* is derived from the "
"program name (``sys.argv[0]``)."
msgstr ""

msgid "*className*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Name of the widget class.  Used as a profile file and also as the name with "
"which Tcl is invoked (*argv0* in *interp*)."
msgstr ""

msgid "*useTk*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``True``, initialize the Tk subsystem.  The :func:`tkinter.Tcl() <Tcl>` "
"function sets this to ``False``."
msgstr ""

msgid "*sync*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``True``, execute all X server commands synchronously, so that errors are "
"reported immediately.  Can be used for debugging. (X11 only)"
msgstr ""

msgid "*use*"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Specifies the *id* of the window in which to embed the application, instead "
"of it being created as an independent toplevel window. *id* must be "
"specified in the same way as the value for the -use option for toplevel "
"widgets (that is, it has a form like that returned by :meth:`winfo_id`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that on some platforms this will only work correctly if *id* refers to "
"a Tk frame or toplevel that has its -container option enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`Tk` reads and interprets profile files, named :file:`.{className}."
"tcl` and :file:`.{baseName}.tcl`, into the Tcl interpreter and calls :func:"
"`exec` on the contents of :file:`.{className}.py` and :file:`.{baseName}."
"py`.  The path for the profile files is the :envvar:`HOME` environment "
"variable or, if that isn't defined, then :attr:`os.curdir`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Tk application object created by instantiating :class:`Tk`.  This "
"provides access to the Tcl interpreter.  Each widget that is attached the "
"same instance of :class:`Tk` has the same value for its :attr:`tk` attribute."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The widget object that contains this widget.  For :class:`Tk`, the *master* "
"is :const:`None` because it is the main window.  The terms *master* and "
"*parent* are similar and sometimes used interchangeably as argument names; "
"however, calling :meth:`winfo_parent` returns a string of the widget name "
"whereas :attr:`master` returns the object. *parent*/*child* reflects the "
"tree-like relationship while *master*/*slave* reflects the container "
"structure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The immediate descendants of this widget as a :class:`dict` with the child "
"widget names as the keys and the child instance objects as the values."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`Tcl` function is a factory function which creates an object much "
"like that created by the :class:`Tk` class, except that it does not "
"initialize the Tk subsystem.  This is most often useful when driving the Tcl "
"interpreter in an environment where one doesn't want to create extraneous "
"toplevel windows, or where one cannot (such as Unix/Linux systems without an "
"X server).  An object created by the :func:`Tcl` object can have a Toplevel "
"window created (and the Tk subsystem initialized) by calling its :meth:"
"`loadtk` method."

"how the Tkinter wrapper is structured."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The remainder of this section will help you to identify the classes, "
"methods, and options you'll need in your Tkinter application, and where to "
"find more detailed documentation on them, including in the official Tcl/Tk "
"reference manual."
msgstr ""

msgid "A Hello World Program"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We'll start by walking through a \"Hello World\" application in Tkinter. "
"This isn't the smallest one we could write, but has enough to illustrate "
"some key concepts you'll need to know."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After the imports, the next line creates an instance of the :class:`Tk` "
"class, which initializes Tk and creates its associated Tcl interpreter. It "
"also creates a toplevel window, known as the root window, which serves as "
"the main window of the application."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following line creates a frame widget, which in this case will contain a "
"label and a button we'll create next. The frame is fit inside the root "
"window."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The next line creates a label widget holding a static text string. The :meth:"
"`grid` method is used to specify the relative layout (position) of the label "
"within its containing frame widget, similar to how tables in HTML work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A button widget is then created, and placed to the right of the label. When "
"pressed, it will call the :meth:`destroy` method of the root window."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, the :meth:`mainloop` method puts everything on the display, and "
"responds to user input until the program terminates."
msgstr ""

msgid "Important Tk Concepts"
msgstr ""

msgid "Even this simple program illustrates the following key Tk concepts:"
msgstr ""

msgid "widgets"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Tkinter user interface is made up of individual *widgets*. Each widget is "
"represented as a Python object, instantiated from classes like :class:`ttk."
"Frame`, :class:`ttk.Label`, and :class:`ttk.Button`."
msgstr ""

msgid "widget hierarchy"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Widgets are arranged in a *hierarchy*. The label and button were contained "
"within a frame, which in turn was contained within the root window. When "
"creating each *child* widget, its *parent* widget is passed as the first "
"argument to the widget constructor."
msgstr ""

msgid "configuration options"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Widgets have *configuration options*, which modify their appearance and "
"behavior, such as the text to display in a label or button. Different "
"classes of widgets will have different sets of options."
msgstr ""

msgid "geometry management"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Widgets aren't automatically added to the user interface when they are "
"created. A *geometry manager* like ``grid`` controls where in the user "
"interface they are placed."
msgstr ""

msgid "event loop"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tkinter reacts to user input, changes from your program, and even refreshes "
"the display only when actively running an *event loop*. If your program "
"isn't running the event loop, your user interface won't update."
msgstr ""

msgid "Understanding How Tkinter Wraps Tcl/Tk"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When your application uses Tkinter's classes and methods, internally Tkinter "
"is assembling strings representing Tcl/Tk commands, and executing those "
"commands in the Tcl interpreter attached to your applicaton's :class:`Tk` "
"instance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whether it's trying to navigate reference documentation, trying to find the "
"right method or option, adapting some existing code, or debugging your "
"Tkinter application, there are times that it will be useful to understand "
"what those underlying Tcl/Tk commands look like."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To illustrate, here is the Tcl/Tk equivalent of the main part of the Tkinter "
"script above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tcl's syntax is similar to many shell languages, where the first word is the "
"command to be executed, with arguments to that command following it, "
"separated by spaces. Without getting into too many details, notice the "
"following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The commands used to create widgets (like ``ttk::frame``) correspond to "
"widget classes in Tkinter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tcl widget options (like ``-text``) correspond to keyword arguments in "
"Tkinter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Widgets are referred to by a *pathname* in Tcl (like ``.frm.btn``), whereas "
"Tkinter doesn't use names but object references."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A widget's place in the widget hierarchy is encoded in its (hierarchical) "
"pathname, which uses a ``.`` (dot) as a path separator. The pathname for the "
"root window is just ``.`` (dot). In Tkinter, the hierarchy is defined not by "
"pathname but by specifying the parent widget when creating each child widget."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Operations which are implemented as separate *commands* in Tcl (like "
"``grid`` or ``destroy``) are represented as *methods* on Tkinter widget "
"objects. As you'll see shortly, at other times Tcl uses what appear to be "
"method calls on widget objects, which more closely mirror what would is used "
"in Tkinter."
msgstr ""

msgid "How do I...? What option does...?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you're not sure how to do something in Tkinter, and you can't immediately "
"find it in the tutorial or reference documentation you're using, there are a "
"few strategies that can be helpful."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"First, remember that the details of how individual widgets work may vary "
"across different versions of both Tkinter and Tcl/Tk. If you're searching "
"documentation, make sure it corresponds to the Python and Tcl/Tk versions "
"installed on your system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When searching for how to use an API, it helps to know the exact name of the "
"class, option, or method that you're using. Introspection, either in an "
"interactive Python shell or with :func:`print`, can help you identify what "
"you need."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To find out what configuration options are available on any widget, call "
"its :meth:`configure` method, which returns a dictionary containing a "
"variety of information about each object, including its default and current "
"values. Use :meth:`keys` to get just the names of each option."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As most widgets have many configuration options in common, it can be useful "
"to find out which are specific to a particular widget class. Comparing the "
"list of options to that of a simpler widget, like a frame, is one way to do "
"that."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similarly, you can find the available methods for a widget object using the "
"standard :func:`dir` function. If you try it, you'll see there are over 200 "
"common widget methods, so again identifying those specific to a widget class "
"is helpful."
msgstr ""

msgid "Navigating the Tcl/Tk Reference Manual"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As noted, the official `Tk commands <https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/"
"contents.htm>`_ reference manual (man pages) is often the most accurate "
"description of what specific operations on widgets do. Even when you know "
"the name of the option or method that you need, you may still have a few "
"places to look."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While all operations in Tkinter are implemented as method calls on widget "
"objects, you've seen that many Tcl/Tk operations appear as commands that "
"take a widget pathname as its first parameter, followed by optional "
"parameters, e.g."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Others, however, look more like methods called on a widget object (in fact, "
"when you create a widget in Tcl/Tk, it creates a Tcl command with the name "
"of the widget pathname, with the first parameter to that command being the "
"name of a method to call)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the official Tcl/Tk reference documentation, you'll find most operations "
"that look like method calls on the man page for a specific widget (e.g., "
"you'll find the :meth:`invoke` method on the `ttk::button <https://www.tcl."
"tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/ttk_button.htm>`_ man page), while functions that take a "
"widget as a parameter often have their own man page (e.g., `grid <https://"
"www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/grid.htm>`_)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You'll find many common options and methods in the `options <https://www.tcl."
"tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/options.htm>`_ or `ttk::widget <https://www.tcl.tk/man/"
"tcl8.6/TkCmd/ttk_widget.htm>`_ man pages, while others are found in the man "
"page for a specific widget class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You'll also find that many Tkinter methods have compound names, e.g., :func:"
"`winfo_x`, :func:`winfo_height`, :func:`winfo_viewable`. You'd find "
"documentation for all of these in the `winfo <https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/"
"TkCmd/winfo.htm>`_ man page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Somewhat confusingly, there are also methods on all Tkinter widgets that "
"don't actually operate on the widget, but operate at a global scope, "
"independent of any widget. Examples are methods for accessing the clipboard "
"or the system bell. (They happen to be implemented as methods in the base :"
"class:`Widget` class that all Tkinter widgets inherit from)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Threading model"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python and Tcl/Tk have very different threading models, which :mod:`tkinter` "
"tries to bridge. If you use threads, you may need to be aware of this."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Python interpreter may have many threads associated with it. In Tcl, "
"multiple threads can be created, but each thread has a separate Tcl "
"interpreter instance associated with it. Threads can also create more than "
"one interpreter instance, though each interpreter instance can be used only "
"by the one thread that created it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Each :class:`Tk` object created by :mod:`tkinter` contains a Tcl "
"interpreter. It also keeps track of which thread created that interpreter. "
"Calls to :mod:`tkinter` can be made from any Python thread. Internally, if a "
"call comes from a thread other than the one that created the :class:`Tk` "
"object, an event is posted to the interpreter's event queue, and when "
"executed, the result is returned to the calling Python thread."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tcl/Tk applications are normally event-driven, meaning that after "
"initialization, the interpreter runs an event loop (i.e. :func:`Tk."
"mainloop`) and responds to events. Because it is single-threaded, event "
"handlers must respond quickly, otherwise they will block other events from "
"being processed. To avoid this, any long-running computations should not run "
"in an event handler, but are either broken into smaller pieces using timers, "
"or run in another thread. This is different from many GUI toolkits where the "
"GUI runs in a completely separate thread from all application code including "
"event handlers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the Tcl interpreter is not running the event loop and processing events, "
"any :mod:`tkinter` calls made from threads other than the one running the "
"Tcl interpreter will fail."
msgstr ""

msgid "A number of special cases exist:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tcl/Tk libraries can be built so they are not thread-aware. In this case, :"
"mod:`tkinter` calls the library from the originating Python thread, even if "
"this is different than the thread that created the Tcl interpreter. A global "
"lock ensures only one call occurs at a time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While :mod:`tkinter` allows you to create more than one instance of a :class:"
"`Tk` object (with its own interpreter), all interpreters that are part of "
"the same thread share a common event queue, which gets ugly fast. In "
"practice, don't create more than one instance of :class:`Tk` at a time. "
"Otherwise, it's best to create them in separate threads and ensure you're "
"running a thread-aware Tcl/Tk build."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Blocking event handlers are not the only way to prevent the Tcl interpreter "
"from reentering the event loop. It is even possible to run multiple nested "
"event loops or abandon the event loop entirely. If you're doing anything "
"tricky when it comes to events or threads, be aware of these possibilities."

"No distinction between standard and widget-specific options is made in this "

msgid "The Packer"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The packer is one of Tk's geometry-management mechanisms.    Geometry "
"managers are used to specify the relative positioning of widgets within "
"their container - their mutual *master*.  In contrast to the more cumbersome "
"*placer* (which is used less commonly, and we do not cover here), the packer "
"takes qualitative relationship specification - *above*, *to the left of*, "
"*filling*, etc - and works everything out to determine the exact placement "
"coordinates for you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The size of any *master* widget is determined by the size of the \"slave "
"widgets\" inside.  The packer is used to control where slave widgets appear "
"inside the master into which they are packed.  You can pack widgets into "
"frames, and frames into other frames, in order to achieve the kind of layout "
"you desire. Additionally, the arrangement is dynamically adjusted to "
"accommodate incremental changes to the configuration, once it is packed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that widgets do not appear until they have had their geometry specified "
"with a geometry manager.  It's a common early mistake to leave out the "
"geometry specification, and then be surprised when the widget is created but "
"nothing appears.  A widget will appear only after it has had, for example, "
"the packer's :meth:`pack` method applied to it."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The current-value setting of some widgets (like text entry widgets) can be "
"connected directly to application variables by using special options.  These "
"options are ``variable``, ``textvariable``, ``onvalue``, ``offvalue``, and "
"``value``.  This connection works both ways: if the variable changes for any "
"reason, the widget it's connected to will be updated to reflect the new "
"value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unfortunately, in the current implementation of :mod:`tkinter` it is not "
"possible to hand over an arbitrary Python variable to a widget through a "
"``variable`` or ``textvariable`` option.  The only kinds of variables for "
"which this works are variables that are subclassed from a class called "
"Variable, defined in :mod:`tkinter`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are many useful subclasses of Variable already defined: :class:"
"`StringVar`, :class:`IntVar`, :class:`DoubleVar`, and :class:`BooleanVar`.  "
"To read the current value of such a variable, call the :meth:`get` method on "
"it, and to change its value you call the :meth:`!set` method.  If you follow "
"this protocol, the widget will always track the value of the variable, with "
"no further intervention on your part."

msgid "The Window Manager"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In Tk, there is a utility command, ``wm``, for interacting with the window "
"manager.  Options to the ``wm`` command allow you to control things like "
"titles, placement, icon bitmaps, and the like.  In :mod:`tkinter`, these "
"commands have been implemented as methods on the :class:`Wm` class.  "
"Toplevel widgets are subclassed from the :class:`Wm` class, and so can call "
"the :class:`Wm` methods directly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To get at the toplevel window that contains a given widget, you can often "
"just refer to the widget's master.  Of course if the widget has been packed "
"inside of a frame, the master won't represent a toplevel window.  To get at "
"the toplevel window that contains an arbitrary widget, you can call the :"
"meth:`_root` method. This method begins with an underscore to denote the "
"fact that this function is part of the implementation, and not an interface "
"to Tk functionality."
