"This module is part of the legacy (``Compat32``) email API.  In the new API "
"the functionality is provided by the *cte* parameter of the :meth:`~email."
"message.EmailMessage.set_content` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module is deprecated in Python 3.  The functions provided here should "
"not be called explicitly since the :class:`~email.mime.text.MIMEText` class "
"sets the content type and CTE header using the *_subtype* and *_charset* "
"values passed during the instantiation of that class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The remaining text in this section is the original documentation of the "
"module."

msgid ""
"When creating :class:`~email.message.Message` objects from scratch, you "
"often need to encode the payloads for transport through compliant mail "
"servers. This is especially true for :mimetype:`image/\\*` and :mimetype:"
"`text/\\*` type messages containing binary data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`email` package provides some convenient encoders in its :mod:"
"`encoders` module.  These encoders are actually used by the :class:`~email."
"mime.audio.MIMEAudio` and :class:`~email.mime.image.MIMEImage` class "
"constructors to provide default encodings.  All encoder functions take "
"exactly one argument, the message object to encode.  They usually extract "
"the payload, encode it, and reset the payload to this newly encoded value.  "
"They should also set the :mailheader:`Content-Transfer-Encoding` header as "
"appropriate."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that these functions are not meaningful for a multipart message.  They "
"must be applied to individual subparts instead, and will raise a :exc:"
"`TypeError` if passed a message whose type is multipart."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are the encoding functions provided:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Encodes the payload into quoted-printable form and sets the :mailheader:"
"`Content-Transfer-Encoding` header to ``quoted-printable`` [#]_. This is a "
"good encoding to use when most of your payload is normal printable data, but "
"contains a few unprintable characters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Encodes the payload into base64 form and sets the :mailheader:`Content-"
"Transfer-Encoding` header to ``base64``.  This is a good encoding to use "
"when most of your payload is unprintable data since it is a more compact "
"form than quoted-printable.  The drawback of base64 encoding is that it "
"renders the text non-human readable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This doesn't actually modify the message's payload, but it does set the :"
"mailheader:`Content-Transfer-Encoding` header to either ``7bit`` or ``8bit`` "
"as appropriate, based on the payload data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This does nothing; it doesn't even set the :mailheader:`Content-Transfer-"
"Encoding` header."

"Note that encoding with :meth:`encode_quopri` also encodes all tabs and "
"space characters in the data."
