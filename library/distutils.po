":mod:`distutils` is deprecated with removal planned for Python 3.12. See "
"the :ref:`What's New <distutils-deprecated>` entry for more information."

"The :mod:`distutils` package provides support for building and installing "
"additional modules into a Python installation.  The new modules may be "
"either 100%-pure Python, or may be extension modules written in C, or may be "
"collections of Python packages which include modules coded in both Python "
"and C."

"Most Python users will *not* want to use this module directly, but instead "
"use the cross-version tools maintained by the Python Packaging Authority. In "
"particular, `setuptools <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ is "
"an enhanced alternative to :mod:`distutils` that provides:"

msgid ""
"the ability to automatically generate Windows command line executables at "

"``distutils``. Refer to the `Python Packaging User Guide <https://packaging."
"python.org>`_ for more information."
