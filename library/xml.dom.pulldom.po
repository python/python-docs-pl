msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`xml.dom.pulldom` module provides a \"pull parser\" which can also "
"be asked to produce DOM-accessible fragments of the document where "
"necessary. The basic concept involves pulling \"events\" from a stream of "
"incoming XML and processing them. In contrast to SAX which also employs an "
"event-driven processing model together with callbacks, the user of a pull "
"parser is responsible for explicitly pulling events from the stream, looping "
"over those events until either processing is finished or an error condition "
"occurs."

msgid ""
"The :mod:`xml.dom.pulldom` module is not secure against maliciously "
"constructed data.  If you need to parse untrusted or unauthenticated data "
"see :ref:`xml-vulnerabilities`."

"The SAX parser no longer processes general external entities by default to "
"increase security by default. To enable processing of external entities, "

"``node`` is an object of type :class:`xml.dom.minidom.Document`, :class:`xml."

msgid ""
"Since the document is treated as a \"flat\" stream of events, the document "
"\"tree\" is implicitly traversed and the desired elements are found "
"regardless of their depth in the tree. In other words, one does not need to "
"consider hierarchical issues such as recursive searching of the document "
"nodes, although if the context of elements were important, one would either "
"need to maintain some context-related state (i.e. remembering where one is "
"in the document at any given point) or to make use of the :func:"
"`DOMEventStream.expandNode` method and switch to DOM-related processing."

"change the document handler of the parser and activate namespace support; "
