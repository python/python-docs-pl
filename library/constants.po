msgid "Built-in Constants"
msgstr ""

msgid "A small number of constants live in the built-in namespace.  They are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The false value of the :class:`bool` type. Assignments to ``False`` are "
"illegal and raise a :exc:`SyntaxError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The true value of the :class:`bool` type. Assignments to ``True`` are "
"illegal and raise a :exc:`SyntaxError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An object frequently used to represent the absence of a value, as when "
"default arguments are not passed to a function. Assignments to ``None`` are "
"illegal and raise a :exc:`SyntaxError`. ``None`` is the sole instance of "
"the :data:`NoneType` type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A special value which should be returned by the binary special methods (e."
"g. :meth:`__eq__`, :meth:`__lt__`, :meth:`__add__`, :meth:`__rsub__`, etc.) "
"to indicate that the operation is not implemented with respect to the other "
"type; may be returned by the in-place binary special methods (e.g. :meth:"
"`__imul__`, :meth:`__iand__`, etc.) for the same purpose. It should not be "
"evaluated in a boolean context. ``NotImplemented`` is the sole instance of "
"the :data:`types.NotImplementedType` type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a binary (or in-place) method returns ``NotImplemented`` the "
"interpreter will try the reflected operation on the other type (or some "
"other fallback, depending on the operator).  If all attempts return "
"``NotImplemented``, the interpreter will raise an appropriate exception. "
"Incorrectly returning ``NotImplemented`` will result in a misleading error "
"message or the ``NotImplemented`` value being returned to Python code."
msgstr ""

msgid "See :ref:`implementing-the-arithmetic-operations` for examples."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``NotImplementedError`` and ``NotImplemented`` are not interchangeable, even "
"though they have similar names and purposes. See :exc:`NotImplementedError` "
"for details on when to use it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Evaluating ``NotImplemented`` in a boolean context is deprecated. While it "
"currently evaluates as true, it will emit a :exc:`DeprecationWarning`. It "
"will raise a :exc:`TypeError` in a future version of Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same as the ellipsis literal \"``...``\". Special value used mostly in "
"conjunction with extended slicing syntax for user-defined container data "
"types. ``Ellipsis`` is the sole instance of the :data:`types.EllipsisType` "
"type."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This constant is true if Python was not started with an :option:`-O` option. "
"See also the :keyword:`assert` statement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The names :data:`None`, :data:`False`, :data:`True` and :data:`__debug__` "
"cannot be reassigned (assignments to them, even as an attribute name, raise :"
"exc:`SyntaxError`), so they can be considered \"true\" constants."
msgstr ""

msgid "Constants added by the :mod:`site` module"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`site` module (which is imported automatically during startup, "
"except if the :option:`-S` command-line option is given) adds several "
"constants to the built-in namespace.  They are useful for the interactive "
"interpreter shell and should not be used in programs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Objects that when printed, print a message like \"Use quit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. "
"EOF) to exit\", and when called, raise :exc:`SystemExit` with the specified "
"exit code."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Objects that when printed or called, print the text of copyright or credits, "
"respectively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Object that when printed, prints the message \"Type license() to see the "
"full license text\", and when called, displays the full license text in a "
"pager-like fashion (one screen at a time)."
