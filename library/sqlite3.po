"SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that "
"doesn't require a separate server process and allows accessing the database "
"using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can "
"use SQLite for internal data storage.  It's also possible to prototype an "
"application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as "
"PostgreSQL or Oracle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`!sqlite3` module was written by Gerhard Häring.  It provides an "
"SQL interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by :pep:"
"`249`, and requires SQLite 3.7.15 or newer."

"First, we need to create a new database and open a database connection to "

"The returned :class:`Connection` object ``con`` represents the connection to "

msgid ""
"Now that we've got a database connection and a cursor, we can create a "
"database table ``movie`` with columns for title, release year, and review "

"types is optional. Execute the ``CREATE TABLE`` statement by calling :meth:"
"`cur.execute(...) <Cursor.execute>`:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can verify that the new table has been created by querying the "
"``sqlite_master`` table built-in to SQLite, which should now contain an "
