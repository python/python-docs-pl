"SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that "
"doesn't require a separate server process and allows accessing the database "
"using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can "
"use SQLite for internal data storage.  It's also possible to prototype an "
"application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as "
"PostgreSQL or Oracle."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`!sqlite3` module was written by Gerhard Häring.  It provides an "
"SQL interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by :pep:"
"`249`, and requires SQLite 3.7.15 or newer."

"Now that we've got a database connection and a cursor, we can create a "
