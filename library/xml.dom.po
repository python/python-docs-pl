msgid ":mod:`xml.dom` --- The Document Object Model API"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/xml/dom/__init__.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Document Object Model, or \"DOM,\" is a cross-language API from the "
"World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for accessing and modifying XML documents.  "
"A DOM implementation presents an XML document as a tree structure, or allows "
"client code to build such a structure from scratch.  It then gives access to "
"the structure through a set of objects which provided well-known interfaces."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The DOM is extremely useful for random-access applications.  SAX only allows "
"you a view of one bit of the document at a time.  If you are looking at one "
"SAX element, you have no access to another.  If you are looking at a text "
"node, you have no access to a containing element. When you write a SAX "
"application, you need to keep track of your program's position in the "
"document somewhere in your own code.  SAX does not do it for you.  Also, if "
"you need to look ahead in the XML document, you are just out of luck."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some applications are simply impossible in an event driven model with no "
"access to a tree.  Of course you could build some sort of tree yourself in "
"SAX events, but the DOM allows you to avoid writing that code.  The DOM is a "
"standard tree representation for XML data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Document Object Model is being defined by the W3C in stages, or "
"\"levels\" in their terminology.  The Python mapping of the API is "
"substantially based on the DOM Level 2 recommendation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"DOM applications typically start by parsing some XML into a DOM.  How this "
"is accomplished is not covered at all by DOM Level 1, and Level 2 provides "
"only limited improvements: There is a :class:`DOMImplementation` object "
"class which provides access to :class:`Document` creation methods, but no "
"way to access an XML reader/parser/Document builder in an implementation-"
"independent way. There is also no well-defined way to access these methods "
"without an existing :class:`Document` object.  In Python, each DOM "
"implementation will provide a function :func:`getDOMImplementation`. DOM "
"Level 3 adds a Load/Store specification, which defines an interface to the "
"reader, but this is not yet available in the Python standard library."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you have a DOM document object, you can access the parts of your XML "
"document through its properties and methods.  These properties are defined "
"in the DOM specification; this portion of the reference manual describes the "
"interpretation of the specification in Python."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The specification provided by the W3C defines the DOM API for Java, "
"ECMAScript, and OMG IDL.  The Python mapping defined here is based in large "
"part on the IDL version of the specification, but strict compliance is not "
"required (though implementations are free to support the strict mapping from "
"IDL).  See section :ref:`dom-conformance` for a detailed discussion of "
"mapping requirements."

"Register the *factory* function with the name *name*.  The factory function "

"if that implementation supports some customization)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a suitable DOM implementation. The *name* is either well-known, the "
"module name of a DOM implementation, or ``None``. If it is not ``None``, "
"imports the corresponding module and returns a :class:`DOMImplementation` "

"variable :envvar:`PYTHON_DOM` is set, this variable is used to find the "
"implementation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If name is not given, this examines the available implementations to find "
"one with the required feature set.  If no implementation can be found, raise "
"an :exc:`ImportError`.  The features list must be a sequence of ``(feature, "

msgid ""
"The Python DOM API, however, *does* require that normal attribute access "

"compilers are not likely to work, and wrapper objects may be needed on the "
"client if the DOM objects are accessed via CORBA. While this does require "
"some additional consideration for CORBA DOM clients, the implementers with "
"experience using DOM over CORBA from Python do not consider this a problem.  "
"Attributes that are declared ``readonly`` may not restrict write access in "
"all DOM implementations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the Python DOM API, accessor functions are not required.  If provided, "
"they should take the form defined by the Python IDL mapping, but these "

"``readonly`` attributes."

"implementations to enforce such requirements."
