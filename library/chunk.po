"This module provides an interface for reading files that use EA IFF 85 "
"chunks. [#]_  This format is used in at least the Audio Interchange File "
"Format (AIFF/AIFF-C) and the Real Media File Format (RMFF).  The WAVE audio "
"file format is closely related and can also be read using this module."

"Usually an IFF-type file consists of one or more chunks.  The proposed usage "
"of the :class:`Chunk` class defined here is to instantiate an instance at "
"the start of each chunk and read from the instance until it reaches the end, "
"after which a new instance can be instantiated. At the end of the file, "
"creating a new instance will fail with an :exc:`EOFError` exception."

"Class which represents a chunk.  The *file* argument is expected to be a "
"file-like object.  An instance of this class is specifically allowed.  The "
"only method that is needed is :meth:`~io.IOBase.read`.  If the methods :meth:"
"`~io.IOBase.seek` and :meth:`~io.IOBase.tell` are present and don't raise an "
"exception, they are also used. If these methods are present and raise an "
"exception, they are expected to not have altered the object.  If the "
"optional argument *align* is true, chunks are assumed to be aligned on 2-"
"byte boundaries.  If *align* is false, no alignment is assumed.  The default "
"value is true.  If the optional argument *bigendian* is false, the chunk "
"size is assumed to be in little-endian order. This is needed for WAVE audio "
"files. The default value is true.  If the optional argument *inclheader* is "
"true, the size given in the chunk header includes the size of the header.  "
"The default value is false."

"Set the chunk's current position.  The *whence* argument is optional and "
"defaults to ``0`` (absolute file positioning); other values are ``1`` (seek "

"end).  There is no return value. If the underlying file does not allow seek, "
"only forward seeks are allowed."

"negative or omitted, read all data until the end of the chunk.  An empty "
"bytes object is returned when the end of the chunk is encountered "
"immediately."
