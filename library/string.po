msgid "Custom String Formatting"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The built-in string class provides the ability to do complex variable "
"substitutions and value formatting via the :meth:`~str.format` method "
"described in :pep:`3101`.  The :class:`Formatter` class in the :mod:`string` "
"module allows you to create and customize your own string formatting "
"behaviors using the same implementation as the built-in :meth:`~str.format` "
"method."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :class:`Formatter` class has the following public methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The primary API method.  It takes a format string and an arbitrary set of "
"positional and keyword arguments. It is just a wrapper that calls :meth:"
"`vformat`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A format string argument is now :ref:`positional-only <positional-"
"only_parameter>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function does the actual work of formatting.  It is exposed as a "
"separate function for cases where you want to pass in a predefined "
"dictionary of arguments, rather than unpacking and repacking the dictionary "
"as individual arguments using the ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` syntax.  :meth:"
"`vformat` does the work of breaking up the format string into character data "
"and replacement fields.  It calls the various methods described below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition, the :class:`Formatter` defines a number of methods that are "
"intended to be replaced by subclasses:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Loop over the format_string and return an iterable of tuples "
"(*literal_text*, *field_name*, *format_spec*, *conversion*).  This is used "
"by :meth:`vformat` to break the string into either literal text, or "
"replacement fields."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The values in the tuple conceptually represent a span of literal text "
"followed by a single replacement field.  If there is no literal text (which "
"can happen if two replacement fields occur consecutively), then "
"*literal_text* will be a zero-length string.  If there is no replacement "
"field, then the values of *field_name*, *format_spec* and *conversion* will "
"be ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Given *field_name* as returned by :meth:`parse` (see above), convert it to "
"an object to be formatted.  Returns a tuple (obj, used_key).  The default "
"version takes strings of the form defined in :pep:`3101`, such as "
"\"0[name]\" or \"label.title\".  *args* and *kwargs* are as passed in to :"
"meth:`vformat`.  The return value *used_key* has the same meaning as the "
"*key* parameter to :meth:`get_value`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Retrieve a given field value.  The *key* argument will be either an integer "
"or a string.  If it is an integer, it represents the index of the positional "
"argument in *args*; if it is a string, then it represents a named argument "
"in *kwargs*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *args* parameter is set to the list of positional arguments to :meth:"
"`vformat`, and the *kwargs* parameter is set to the dictionary of keyword "
"arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For compound field names, these functions are only called for the first "
"component of the field name; subsequent components are handled through "
"normal attribute and indexing operations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"So for example, the field expression '0.name' would cause :meth:`get_value` "
"to be called with a *key* argument of 0.  The ``name`` attribute will be "
"looked up after :meth:`get_value` returns by calling the built-in :func:"
"`getattr` function."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the index or keyword refers to an item that does not exist, then an :exc:"
"`IndexError` or :exc:`KeyError` should be raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Implement checking for unused arguments if desired.  The arguments to this "
"function is the set of all argument keys that were actually referred to in "
"the format string (integers for positional arguments, and strings for named "
"arguments), and a reference to the *args* and *kwargs* that was passed to "
"vformat.  The set of unused args can be calculated from these parameters.  :"
"meth:`check_unused_args` is assumed to raise an exception if the check fails."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`format_field` simply calls the global :func:`format` built-in.  The "
"method is provided so that subclasses can override it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Converts the value (returned by :meth:`get_field`) given a conversion type "
"(as in the tuple returned by the :meth:`parse` method).  The default version "
"understands 's' (str), 'r' (repr) and 'a' (ascii) conversion types."
msgstr ""

msgid "Format String Syntax"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :meth:`str.format` method and the :class:`Formatter` class share the "
"same syntax for format strings (although in the case of :class:`Formatter`, "
"subclasses can define their own format string syntax).  The syntax is "
"related to that of :ref:`formatted string literals <f-strings>`, but it is "
"less sophisticated and, in particular, does not support arbitrary "
"expressions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Format strings contain \"replacement fields\" surrounded by curly braces ``{}"
"``. Anything that is not contained in braces is considered literal text, "
"which is copied unchanged to the output.  If you need to include a brace "
"character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling: ``{{`` and ``}}"
"``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The grammar for a replacement field is as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In less formal terms, the replacement field can start with a *field_name* "
"that specifies the object whose value is to be formatted and inserted into "
"the output instead of the replacement field. The *field_name* is optionally "
"followed by a  *conversion* field, which is preceded by an exclamation point "
"``'!'``, and a *format_spec*, which is preceded by a colon ``':'``.  These "
"specify a non-default format for the replacement value."
msgstr ""

msgid "See also the :ref:`formatspec` section."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *field_name* itself begins with an *arg_name* that is either a number or "
"a keyword.  If it's a number, it refers to a positional argument, and if "
"it's a keyword, it refers to a named keyword argument. An *arg_name* is "
"treated as a number if a call to :meth:`str.isdecimal` on the string would "
"return true. If the numerical arg_names in a format string are 0, 1, 2, ... "
"in sequence, they can all be omitted (not just some) and the numbers 0, 1, "
"2, ... will be automatically inserted in that order. Because *arg_name* is "
"not quote-delimited, it is not possible to specify arbitrary dictionary keys "
"(e.g., the strings ``'10'`` or ``':-]'``) within a format string. The "
"*arg_name* can be followed by any number of index or attribute expressions. "
"An expression of the form ``'.name'`` selects the named attribute using :"
"func:`getattr`, while an expression of the form ``'[index]'`` does an index "
"lookup using :meth:`~object.__getitem__`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The positional argument specifiers can be omitted for :meth:`str.format`, so "
"``'{} {}'.format(a, b)`` is equivalent to ``'{0} {1}'.format(a, b)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The positional argument specifiers can be omitted for :class:`Formatter`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some simple format string examples::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *conversion* field causes a type coercion before formatting.  Normally, "
"the job of formatting a value is done by the :meth:`~object.__format__` "
"method of the value itself.  However, in some cases it is desirable to force "
"a type to be formatted as a string, overriding its own definition of "
"formatting.  By converting the value to a string before calling :meth:"
"`~object.__format__`, the normal formatting logic is bypassed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Three conversion flags are currently supported: ``'!s'`` which calls :func:"
"`str` on the value, ``'!r'`` which calls :func:`repr` and ``'!a'`` which "
"calls :func:`ascii`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Some examples::"
msgstr "Trochę przykładów::"

msgid ""
"The *format_spec* field contains a specification of how the value should be "
"presented, including such details as field width, alignment, padding, "
"decimal precision and so on.  Each value type can define its own "
"\"formatting mini-language\" or interpretation of the *format_spec*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most built-in types support a common formatting mini-language, which is "
"described in the next section."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A *format_spec* field can also include nested replacement fields within it. "
"These nested replacement fields may contain a field name, conversion flag "
"and format specification, but deeper nesting is not allowed.  The "
"replacement fields within the format_spec are substituted before the "
"*format_spec* string is interpreted. This allows the formatting of a value "
"to be dynamically specified."
msgstr ""

msgid "See the :ref:`formatexamples` section for some examples."
msgstr ""

msgid "Format Specification Mini-Language"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\"Format specifications\" are used within replacement fields contained "
"within a format string to define how individual values are presented (see :"
"ref:`formatstrings` and :ref:`f-strings`). They can also be passed directly "
"to the built-in :func:`format` function.  Each formattable type may define "
"how the format specification is to be interpreted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most built-in types implement the following options for format "
"specifications, although some of the formatting options are only supported "
"by the numeric types."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A general convention is that an empty format specification produces the same "
"result as if you had called :func:`str` on the value. A non-empty format "
"specification typically modifies the result."
msgstr ""

msgid "The general form of a *standard format specifier* is:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a valid *align* value is specified, it can be preceded by a *fill* "
"character that can be any character and defaults to a space if omitted. It "
"is not possible to use a literal curly brace (\"``{``\" or \"``}``\") as the "
"*fill* character in a :ref:`formatted string literal <f-strings>` or when "
"using the :meth:`str.format` method.  However, it is possible to insert a "
"curly brace with a nested replacement field.  This limitation doesn't affect "
"the :func:`format` function."
msgstr ""

msgid "The meaning of the various alignment options is as follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Option"
msgstr ""

msgid "Meaning"
msgstr "Znaczenie"

msgid "``'<'``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Forces the field to be left-aligned within the available space (this is the "

msgstr ""

msgid "``'>'``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Forces the field to be right-aligned within the available space (this is the "
"default for numbers)."
msgstr ""

msgid "``'='``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Forces the padding to be placed after the sign (if any) but before the "
"digits.  This is used for printing fields in the form '+000000120'. This "
"alignment option is only valid for numeric types.  It becomes the default "
"for numbers when '0' immediately precedes the field width."
msgstr ""

msgid "``'^'``"
msgstr ""

msgid "Forces the field to be centered within the available space."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that unless a minimum field width is defined, the field width will "
"always be the same size as the data to fill it, so that the alignment option "
"has no meaning in this case."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *sign* option is only valid for number types, and can be one of the "
"following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``'+'``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"indicates that a sign should be used for both positive as well as negative "
"numbers."
msgstr ""

msgid "``'-'``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"indicates that a sign should be used only for negative numbers (this is the "
"default behavior)."
msgstr ""

msgid "space"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"indicates that a leading space should be used on positive numbers, and a "
"minus sign on negative numbers."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``'z'`` option coerces negative zero floating-point values to positive "
"zero after rounding to the format precision.  This option is only valid for "
"floating-point presentation types."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the ``'z'`` option (see also :pep:`682`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``'#'`` option causes the \"alternate form\" to be used for the "
"conversion.  The alternate form is defined differently for different types.  "
"This option is only valid for integer, float and complex types. For "
"integers, when binary, octal, or hexadecimal output is used, this option "
"adds the respective prefix ``'0b'``, ``'0o'``, ``'0x'``, or ``'0X'`` to the "
"output value. For float and complex the alternate form causes the result of "
"the conversion to always contain a decimal-point character, even if no "
"digits follow it. Normally, a decimal-point character appears in the result "
"of these conversions only if a digit follows it. In addition, for ``'g'`` "
"and ``'G'`` conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``','`` option signals the use of a comma for a thousands separator. For "
"a locale aware separator, use the ``'n'`` integer presentation type instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the ``','`` option (see also :pep:`378`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``'_'`` option signals the use of an underscore for a thousands "
"separator for floating point presentation types and for integer presentation "
"type ``'d'``.  For integer presentation types ``'b'``, ``'o'``, ``'x'``, and "
"``'X'``, underscores will be inserted every 4 digits.  For other "
"presentation types, specifying this option is an error."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the ``'_'`` option (see also :pep:`515`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*width* is a decimal integer defining the minimum total field width, "
"including any prefixes, separators, and other formatting characters. If not "
"specified, then the field width will be determined by the content."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When no explicit alignment is given, preceding the *width* field by a zero "
"(``'0'``) character enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types.  This "
"is equivalent to a *fill* character of ``'0'`` with an *alignment* type of "
"``'='``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Preceding the *width* field by ``'0'`` no longer affects the default "
"alignment for strings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *precision* is a decimal integer indicating how many digits should be "
"displayed after the decimal point for presentation types ``'f'`` and "
"``'F'``, or before and after the decimal point for presentation types "
"``'g'`` or ``'G'``.  For string presentation types the field indicates the "
"maximum field size - in other words, how many characters will be used from "
"the field content.  The *precision* is not allowed for integer presentation "
"types."

"there are duplicates, the placeholders from *kwds* take precedence."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Like :meth:`substitute`, except that if placeholders are missing from "

"dangling delimiters, unmatched braces, or placeholders that are not valid "

"Advanced usage: you can derive subclasses of :class:`Template` to customize "
"the placeholder syntax, delimiter character, or the entire regular "
"expression used to parse template strings.  To do this, you can override "
"these class attributes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*delimiter* -- This is the literal string describing a placeholder "
"introducing delimiter.  The default value is ``$``.  Note that this should "
"*not* be a regular expression, as the implementation will call :meth:`re."
"escape` on this string as needed.  Note further that you cannot change the "
"delimiter after class creation (i.e. a different delimiter must be set in "
"the subclass's class namespace)."

msgid ""
"*idpattern* -- This is the regular expression describing the pattern for non-"
"braced placeholders.  The default value is the regular expression ``(?a:[_a-"
"z][_a-z0-9]*)``.  If this is given and *braceidpattern* is ``None`` this "
"pattern will also apply to braced placeholders."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since default *flags* is ``re.IGNORECASE``, pattern ``[a-z]`` can match with "
"some non-ASCII characters. That's why we use the local ``a`` flag here."

"*braceidpattern* can be used to define separate patterns used inside and "
"outside the braces."

msgid ""
"*braceidpattern* -- This is like *idpattern* but describes the pattern for "
"braced placeholders.  Defaults to ``None`` which means to fall back to "
"*idpattern* (i.e. the same pattern is used both inside and outside braces). "
"If given, this allows you to define different patterns for braced and "
"unbraced placeholders."
msgstr ""

"*flags* -- The regular expression flags that will be applied when compiling "
"the regular expression used for recognizing substitutions.  The default "
"value is ``re.IGNORECASE``.  Note that ``re.VERBOSE`` will always be added "
"to the flags, so custom *idpattern*\\ s must follow conventions for verbose "
"regular expressions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can provide the entire regular expression pattern by "
"overriding the class attribute *pattern*.  If you do this, the value must be "
"a regular expression object with four named capturing groups.  The capturing "
"groups correspond to the rules given above, along with the invalid "
"placeholder rule:"

msgid ""
"*escaped* -- This group matches the escape sequence, e.g. ``$$``, in the "
"default pattern."
