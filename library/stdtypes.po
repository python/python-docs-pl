"practically all objects can be compared for equality, tested for truth "

"numeric types :mod:`fractions.Fraction`, for rationals, and :mod:`decimal."
"Decimal`, for floating-point numbers with user-definable precision.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Numbers are created by numeric literals or as the result of built-in "
"functions and operators.  Unadorned integer literals (including hex, octal "
"and binary numbers) yield integers.  Numeric literals containing a decimal "
"point or an exponent sign yield floating point numbers.  Appending ``'j'`` "

"Python fully supports mixed arithmetic: when a binary arithmetic operator "
"has operands of different numeric types, the operand with the \"narrower\" "

"Two methods support conversion to and from hexadecimal strings.  Since "

"of the C99 standard, and also to the syntax used in Java 1.5 onwards.  In "
"particular, the output of :meth:`float.hex` is usable as a hexadecimal "

"For numbers ``x`` and ``y``, possibly of different types, it's a requirement "

"implementation and efficiency across a variety of numeric types (including :"

"function that's defined for any rational number, and hence applies to all "
"instances of :class:`int` and :class:`fractions.Fraction`, and all finite "
"instances of :class:`float` and :class:`decimal.Decimal`.  Essentially, this "
"function is given by reduction modulo ``P`` for a fixed prime ``P``.  The "
"value of ``P`` is made available to Python as the :attr:`modulus` attribute "
"of :data:`sys.hash_info`."

msgstr ""

msgid "Here are the rules in detail:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``x = m / n`` is a nonnegative rational number and ``n`` is not divisible "
"by ``P``, define ``hash(x)`` as ``m * invmod(n, P) % P``, where ``invmod(n, "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``x = m / n`` is a nonnegative rational number and ``n`` is divisible by "
"``P`` (but ``m`` is not) then ``n`` has no inverse modulo ``P`` and the rule "

"value ``sys.hash_info.inf``."

msgid ""
"If ``x = m / n`` is a negative rational number define ``hash(x)`` as ``-"
"hash(-x)``.  If the resulting hash is ``-1``, replace it with ``-2``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The particular values ``sys.hash_info.inf`` and ``-sys.hash_info.inf`` are "
"used as hash values for positive infinity or negative infinity "
"(respectively)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a :class:`complex` number ``z``, the hash values of the real and "
"imaginary parts are combined by computing ``hash(z.real) + sys.hash_info."
"imag * hash(z.imag)``, reduced modulo ``2**sys.hash_info.width`` so that it "
"lies in ``range(-2**(sys.hash_info.width - 1), 2**(sys.hash_info.width - "
"1))``.  Again, if the result is ``-1``, it's replaced with ``-2``."

"The built-in function :func:`bool`  converts any value to a boolean, if the "
"value can be interpreted as a truth value (see section :ref:`truth` above)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For logical operations, use the :ref:`boolean operators <boolean>` ``and``, "
"``or`` and ``not``. When applying the bitwise operators ``&``, ``|``, ``^`` "
"to two booleans, they return a bool equivalent to the logical operations "

msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`bool` is a subclass of :class:`int` (see :ref:`typesnumeric`). In "

"interpreter command line flag to configure the limit:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":envvar:`PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS`, e.g. ``PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS=640 python3`` "
"to set the limit to 640 or ``PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS=0 python3`` to disable "
"the limitation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":option:`-X int_max_str_digits <-X>`, e.g. ``python3 -X "
"int_max_str_digits=640``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":data:`sys.flags.int_max_str_digits` contains the value of :envvar:"
"`PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS` or :option:`-X int_max_str_digits <-X>`. If both the "
"env var and the ``-X`` option are set, the ``-X`` option takes precedence. A "
"value of *-1* indicates that both were unset, thus a value of :data:`sys."
"int_info.default_max_str_digits` was used during initialization."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"From code, you can inspect the current limit and set a new one using these :"
"mod:`sys` APIs:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":func:`sys.get_int_max_str_digits` and :func:`sys.set_int_max_str_digits` "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Setting a low limit *can* lead to problems. While rare, code exists that "
"contains integer constants in decimal in their source that exceed the "
"minimum threshold. A consequence of setting the limit is that Python source "
"code containing decimal integer literals longer than the limit will "
"encounter an error during parsing, usually at startup time or import time or "
"even at installation time - anytime an up to date ``.pyc`` does not already "
"exist for the code. A workaround for source that contains such large "
"constants is to convert them to ``0x`` hexadecimal form as it has no limit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Test your application thoroughly if you use a low limit. Ensure your tests "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default :data:`sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits` is expected to be "
