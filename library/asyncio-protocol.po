msgid "Preface"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Transports and Protocols are used by the **low-level** event loop APIs such "
"as :meth:`loop.create_connection`.  They use callback-based programming "
"style and enable high-performance implementations of network or IPC "
"protocols (e.g. HTTP)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Essentially, transports and protocols should only be used in libraries and "
"frameworks and never in high-level asyncio applications."
msgstr ""

msgid "This documentation page covers both `Transports`_ and `Protocols`_."
msgstr ""

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "Wprowadzenie"

msgid ""
"At the highest level, the transport is concerned with *how* bytes are "
"transmitted, while the protocol determines *which* bytes to transmit (and to "
"some extent when)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A different way of saying the same thing: a transport is an abstraction for "
"a socket (or similar I/O endpoint) while a protocol is an abstraction for an "
"application, from the transport's point of view."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Yet another view is the transport and protocol interfaces together define an "
"abstract interface for using network I/O and interprocess I/O."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is always a 1:1 relationship between transport and protocol objects: "
"the protocol calls transport methods to send data, while the transport calls "
"protocol methods to pass it data that has been received."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most of connection oriented event loop methods (such as :meth:`loop."
"create_connection`) usually accept a *protocol_factory* argument used to "
"create a *Protocol* object for an accepted connection, represented by a "
"*Transport* object. Such methods usually return a tuple of ``(transport, "
"protocol)``."

msgstr ""

msgid "Base Protocols"
msgstr ""

msgid "Base protocol with methods that all protocols share."

msgid ""
"The base class for implementing streaming protocols (TCP, Unix sockets, etc)."

msgid ""
"The base class for implementing protocols communicating with child processes "

msgstr ""

msgid "Base Protocol"
msgstr ""

msgid "All asyncio protocols can implement Base Protocol callbacks."
msgstr ""

msgid "Connection Callbacks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Connection callbacks are called on all protocols, exactly once per a "
"successful connection.  All other protocol callbacks can only be called "
"between those two methods."
msgstr ""

msgid "Called when a connection is made."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *transport* argument is the transport representing the connection.  The "
"protocol is responsible for storing the reference to its transport."
msgstr ""

msgid "Called when the connection is lost or closed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The argument is either an exception object or :const:`None`. The latter "
"means a regular EOF is received, or the connection was aborted or closed by "
"this side of the connection."
msgstr ""

msgid "Flow Control Callbacks"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Flow control callbacks can be called by transports to pause or resume "
"writing performed by the protocol."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the documentation of the :meth:`~WriteTransport.set_write_buffer_limits` "
"method for more details."
msgstr ""

msgid "Called when the transport's buffer goes over the high watermark."
msgstr ""

msgid "Called when the transport's buffer drains below the low watermark."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the buffer size equals the high watermark, :meth:`~BaseProtocol."
"pause_writing` is not called: the buffer size must go strictly over."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Conversely, :meth:`~BaseProtocol.resume_writing` is called when the buffer "
"size is equal or lower than the low watermark.  These end conditions are "
"important to ensure that things go as expected when either mark is zero."

msgid "Streaming Protocols"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Event methods, such as :meth:`loop.create_server`, :meth:`loop."

msgid ""
"Called when some data is received.  *data* is a non-empty bytes object "
"containing the incoming data."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Whether the data is buffered, chunked or reassembled depends on the "
"transport.  In general, you shouldn't rely on specific semantics and instead "
"make your parsing generic and flexible. However, data is always received in "
"the correct order."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The method can be called an arbitrary number of times while a connection is "
"open."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"However, :meth:`protocol.eof_received() <Protocol.eof_received>` is called "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Called when the other end signals it won't send any more data (for example "
"by calling :meth:`transport.write_eof() <WriteTransport.write_eof>`, if the "
"other end also uses asyncio)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method may return a false value (including ``None``), in which case the "
"transport will close itself.  Conversely, if this method returns a true "
"value, the protocol used determines whether to close the transport. Since "
"the default implementation returns ``None``, it implicitly closes the "
"connection."

"Some transports, including SSL, don't support half-closed connections, in "

msgid "Buffered Streaming Protocols"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Buffered Protocols can be used with any event loop method that supports "
"`Streaming Protocols`_."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``BufferedProtocol`` implementations allow explicit manual allocation and "
"control of the receive buffer.  Event loops can then use the buffer provided "
"by the protocol to avoid unnecessary data copies.  This can result in "
"noticeable performance improvement for protocols that receive big amounts of "
"data.  Sophisticated protocol implementations can significantly reduce the "
"number of buffer allocations."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following callbacks are called on :class:`BufferedProtocol` instances:"

msgid "Called to allocate a new receive buffer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*sizehint* is the recommended minimum size for the returned buffer.  It is "

"suggests.  When set to -1, the buffer size can be arbitrary. It is an error "
"to return a buffer with a zero size."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``get_buffer()`` must return an object implementing the :ref:`buffer "
"protocol <bufferobjects>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Called when the buffer was updated with the received data."
msgstr ""

msgid "*nbytes* is the total number of bytes that were written to the buffer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the documentation of the :meth:`protocol.eof_received() <Protocol."
"eof_received>` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`~BufferedProtocol.get_buffer` can be called an arbitrary number of "
"times during a connection.  However, :meth:`protocol.eof_received() "
"<Protocol.eof_received>` is called at most once and, if called, :meth:"
"`~BufferedProtocol.get_buffer` and :meth:`~BufferedProtocol.buffer_updated` "
"won't be called after it."
msgstr ""

msgid "Datagram Protocols"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Datagram Protocol instances should be constructed by protocol factories "
"passed to the :meth:`loop.create_datagram_endpoint` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Called when a datagram is received.  *data* is a bytes object containing the "
"incoming data.  *addr* is the address of the peer sending the data; the "
"exact format depends on the transport."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Called when a previous send or receive operation raises an :class:"
"`OSError`.  *exc* is the :class:`OSError` instance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is called in rare conditions, when the transport (e.g. UDP) "
"detects that a datagram could not be delivered to its recipient. In many "
"conditions though, undeliverable datagrams will be silently dropped."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On BSD systems (macOS, FreeBSD, etc.) flow control is not supported for "
"datagram protocols, because there is no reliable way to detect send failures "
"caused by writing too many packets."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The socket always appears 'ready' and excess packets are dropped. An :class:"
