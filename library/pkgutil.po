msgstr ""

msgid "A namedtuple that holds a brief summary of a module's info."

"Extend the search path for the modules which comprise a package.  Intended "
"use is to place the following code in a package's :file:`__init__.py`::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For each directory on :data:`sys.path` that has a subdirectory that matches "
"the package name, add the subdirectory to the package's :attr:`__path__`.  "
"This is useful if one wants to distribute different parts of a single "
"logical package as multiple directories."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It also looks for :file:`\\*.pkg` files beginning where ``*`` matches the "
"*name* argument.  This feature is similar to :file:`\\*.pth` files (see the :"
"mod:`site` module for more information), except that it doesn't special-case "
"lines starting with ``import``.  A :file:`\\*.pkg` file is trusted at face "
"value: apart from checking for duplicates, all entries found in a :file:`\\*."
"pkg` file are added to the path, regardless of whether they exist on the "
"filesystem.  (This is a feature.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the input path is not a list (as is the case for frozen packages) it is "
"returned unchanged.  The input path is not modified; an extended copy is "
"returned.  Items are only appended to the copy at the end."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is assumed that :data:`sys.path` is a sequence.  Items of :data:`sys."
"path` that are not strings referring to existing directories are ignored. "
"Unicode items on :data:`sys.path` that cause errors when used as filenames "
"may cause this function to raise an exception (in line with :func:`os.path."
"isdir` behavior)."

msgid ":pep:`302` Finder that wraps Python's \"classic\" import algorithm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *dirname* is a string, a :pep:`302` finder is created that searches that "

"built-in."

"Note that :class:`ImpImporter` does not currently support being used by "

"If the module or package is accessible via the normal import mechanism, a "

"*onerror* is a function which gets called with one argument (the name of the "

msgid "Get a resource from a package."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a wrapper for the :term:`loader` :meth:`get_data <importlib.abc."
"ResourceLoader.get_data>` API.  The *package* argument should be the name of "
"a package, in standard module format (``foo.bar``).  The *resource* argument "
"should be in the form of a relative filename, using ``/`` as the path "
"separator.  The parent directory name ``..`` is not allowed, and nor is a "
"rooted name (starting with a ``/``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The function returns a binary string that is the contents of the specified "

"For packages located in the filesystem, which have already been imported, "

"If the package cannot be located or loaded, or it uses a :term:`loader` "
"which does not support :meth:`get_data <importlib.abc.ResourceLoader."

"party packages such as setuptools, Django and Pyramid."

"It is expected that *name* will be a string in one of the following formats, "

"The first form is intended for backward compatibility only. It assumes that "
"some part of the dotted name is a package, and the rest is an object "
"somewhere within that package, possibly nested inside other objects. Because "
"the place where the package stops and the object hierarchy starts can't be "
"inferred by inspection, repeated attempts to import must be done with this "
"form."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the second form, the caller makes the division point clear through the "
"provision of a single colon: the dotted name to the left of the colon is a "
"package to be imported, and the dotted name to the right is the object "
"hierarchy within that package. Only one import is needed in this form. If it "
"ends with the colon, then a module object is returned."

"hierarchy within the imported package to get to the desired object."
