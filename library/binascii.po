msgid ":mod:`binascii` --- Convert between binary and ASCII"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`binascii` module contains a number of methods to convert between "
"binary and various ASCII-encoded binary representations. Normally, you will "
"not use these functions directly but use wrapper modules like :mod:`uu` or :"
"mod:`base64` instead. The :mod:`binascii` module contains low-level "
"functions written in C for greater speed that are used by the higher-level "
"modules."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``a2b_*`` functions accept Unicode strings containing only ASCII characters. "
"Other functions only accept :term:`bytes-like objects <bytes-like object>` "
"(such as :class:`bytes`, :class:`bytearray` and other objects that support "
"the buffer protocol)."
msgstr ""

msgid "ASCII-only unicode strings are now accepted by the ``a2b_*`` functions."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`binascii` module defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Convert a single line of uuencoded data back to binary and return the binary "
"data. Lines normally contain 45 (binary) bytes, except for the last line. "
"Line data may be followed by whitespace."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Convert binary data to a line of ASCII characters, the return value is the "
"converted line, including a newline char. The length of *data* should be at "
"most 45. If *backtick* is true, zeros are represented by ``'`'`` instead of "
"spaces."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *backtick* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Convert a block of base64 data back to binary and return the binary data. "
"More than one line may be passed at a time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *strict_mode* is true, only valid base64 data will be converted. Invalid "
"base64 data will raise :exc:`binascii.Error`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Valid base64:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Conforms to :rfc:`3548`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Contains only characters from the base64 alphabet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Contains no excess data after padding (including excess padding, newlines, "
"etc.)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Does not start with a padding."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *strict_mode* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Convert binary data to a line of ASCII characters in base64 coding. The "
"return value is the converted line, including a newline char if *newline* is "
"true.  The output of this function conforms to :rfc:`3548`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *newline* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Convert a block of quoted-printable data back to binary and return the "
"binary data. More than one line may be passed at a time. If the optional "
"argument *header* is present and true, underscores will be decoded as spaces."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Convert binary data to a line(s) of ASCII characters in quoted-printable "
"encoding.  The return value is the converted line(s). If the optional "
"argument *quotetabs* is present and true, all tabs and spaces will be "
"encoded.   If the optional argument *istext* is present and true, newlines "
"are not encoded but trailing whitespace will be encoded. If the optional "
"argument *header* is present and true, spaces will be encoded as underscores "
"per :rfc:`1522`. If the optional argument *header* is present and false, "
"newline characters will be encoded as well; otherwise linefeed conversion "
"might corrupt the binary data stream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Compute a 16-bit CRC value of *data*, starting with *value* as the initial "
"CRC, and return the result.  This uses the CRC-CCITT polynomial *x*:sup:`16` "
"+ *x*:sup:`12` + *x*:sup:`5` + 1, often represented as 0x1021.  This CRC is "
"used in the binhex4 format."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Compute CRC-32, the unsigned 32-bit checksum of *data*, starting with an "
"initial CRC of *value*.  The default initial CRC is zero.  The algorithm is "
"consistent with the ZIP file checksum.  Since the algorithm is designed for "
"use as a checksum algorithm, it is not suitable for use as a general hash "
"algorithm.  Use as follows::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The result is always unsigned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the hexadecimal representation of the binary *data*.  Every byte of "
"*data* is converted into the corresponding 2-digit hex representation.  The "
"returned bytes object is therefore twice as long as the length of *data*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar functionality (but returning a text string) is also conveniently "
"accessible using the :meth:`bytes.hex` method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *sep* is specified, it must be a single character str or bytes object. It "
"will be inserted in the output after every *bytes_per_sep* input bytes. "
"Separator placement is counted from the right end of the output by default, "
"if you wish to count from the left, supply a negative *bytes_per_sep* value."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *sep* and *bytes_per_sep* parameters were added."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the binary data represented by the hexadecimal string *hexstr*.  This "
"function is the inverse of :func:`b2a_hex`. *hexstr* must contain an even "
"number of hexadecimal digits (which can be upper or lower case), otherwise "
"an :exc:`Error` exception is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Similar functionality (accepting only text string arguments, but more "

msgstr ""

msgid "Exception raised on errors. These are usually programming errors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exception raised on incomplete data. These are usually not programming "
