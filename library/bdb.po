msgid ":mod:`bdb` --- Debugger framework"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/bdb.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`bdb` module handles basic debugger functions, like setting "
"breakpoints or managing execution via the debugger."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following exception is defined:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Exception raised by the :class:`Bdb` class for quitting the debugger."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`bdb` module also defines two classes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This class implements temporary breakpoints, ignore counts, disabling and "
"(re-)enabling, and conditionals."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Breakpoints are indexed by number through a list called :attr:`bpbynumber` "
"and by ``(file, line)`` pairs through :attr:`bplist`.  The former points to "
"a single instance of class :class:`Breakpoint`.  The latter points to a list "
"of such instances since there may be more than one breakpoint per line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When creating a breakpoint, its associated :attr:`file name <file>` should "
"be in canonical form.  If a :attr:`funcname` is defined, a breakpoint :attr:"
"`hit <hits>` will be counted when the first line of that function is "
"executed.  A :attr:`conditional <cond>` breakpoint always counts a :attr:"
"`hit <hits>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`Breakpoint` instances have the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Delete the breakpoint from the list associated to a file/line.  If it is the "
"last breakpoint in that position, it also deletes the entry for the file/"
"line."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mark the breakpoint as enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "Mark the breakpoint as disabled."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a string with all the information about the breakpoint, nicely "
"formatted:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Breakpoint number."
msgstr ""

msgid "Temporary status (del or keep)."
msgstr ""

msgid "File/line position."
msgstr ""

msgid "Break condition."
msgstr ""

msgid "Number of times to ignore."
msgstr ""

msgid "Number of times hit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Print the output of :meth:`bpformat` to the file *out*, or if it is "
"``None``, to standard output."
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`Breakpoint` instances have the following attributes:"
msgstr ""

msgid "File name of the :class:`Breakpoint`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Line number of the :class:`Breakpoint` within :attr:`file`."
msgstr ""

msgid "True if a :class:`Breakpoint` at (file, line) is temporary."
msgstr ""

msgid "Condition for evaluating a :class:`Breakpoint` at (file, line)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Function name that defines whether a :class:`Breakpoint` is hit upon "
"entering the function."
msgstr ""

msgid "True if :class:`Breakpoint` is enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "Numeric index for a single instance of a :class:`Breakpoint`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Dictionary of :class:`Breakpoint` instances indexed by (:attr:`file`, :attr:"
"`line`) tuples."
msgstr ""

msgid "Number of times to ignore a :class:`Breakpoint`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Count of the number of times a :class:`Breakpoint` has been hit."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :class:`Bdb` class acts as a generic Python debugger base class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This class takes care of the details of the trace facility; a derived class "
"should implement user interaction.  The standard debugger class (:class:`pdb."
"Pdb`) is an example."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *skip* argument, if given, must be an iterable of glob-style module name "
"patterns.  The debugger will not step into frames that originate in a module "
"that matches one of these patterns. Whether a frame is considered to "
"originate in a certain module is determined by the ``__name__`` in the frame "
"globals."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *skip* argument."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following methods of :class:`Bdb` normally don't need to be overridden."
msgstr ""

msgid "Return canonical form of *filename*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For real file names, the canonical form is an operating-system-dependent, :"
"func:`case-normalized <os.path.normcase>` :func:`absolute path <os.path."
"abspath>`. A *filename* with angle brackets, such as ``\"<stdin>\"`` "
"generated in interactive mode, is returned unchanged."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the :attr:`botframe`, :attr:`stopframe`, :attr:`returnframe` and :attr:"
"`quitting` attributes with values ready to start debugging."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This function is installed as the trace function of debugged frames.  Its "
"return value is the new trace function (in most cases, that is, itself)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The default implementation decides how to dispatch a frame, depending on the "
"type of event (passed as a string) that is about to be executed. *event* can "
"be one of the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``\"line\"``: A new line of code is going to be executed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``\"call\"``: A function is about to be called, or another code block "
"entered."
msgstr ""

msgid "``\"return\"``: A function or other code block is about to return."
msgstr ""

msgid "``\"exception\"``: An exception has occurred."
msgstr ""

msgid "``\"c_call\"``: A C function is about to be called."
msgstr ""

msgid "``\"c_return\"``: A C function has returned."
msgstr ""

msgid "``\"c_exception\"``: A C function has raised an exception."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the Python events, specialized functions (see below) are called.  For "
"the C events, no action is taken."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *arg* parameter depends on the previous event."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See the documentation for :func:`sys.settrace` for more information on the "
"trace function.  For more information on code and frame objects, refer to :"
