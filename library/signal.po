msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/signal.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid "This module provides mechanisms to use signal handlers in Python."
msgstr ""

msgid "General rules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :func:`signal.signal` function allows defining custom handlers to be "
"executed when a signal is received.  A small number of default handlers are "
"installed: :const:`SIGPIPE` is ignored (so write errors on pipes and sockets "
"can be reported as ordinary Python exceptions) and :const:`SIGINT` is "
"translated into a :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt` exception if the parent process "
"has not changed it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A handler for a particular signal, once set, remains installed until it is "
"explicitly reset (Python emulates the BSD style interface regardless of the "
"underlying implementation), with the exception of the handler for :const:"
"`SIGCHLD`, which follows the underlying implementation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On WebAssembly platforms ``wasm32-emscripten`` and ``wasm32-wasi``, signals "
"are emulated and therefore behave differently. Several functions and signals "
"are not available on these platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid "Execution of Python signal handlers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A Python signal handler does not get executed inside the low-level (C) "
"signal handler.  Instead, the low-level signal handler sets a flag which "
"tells the :term:`virtual machine` to execute the corresponding Python signal "
"handler at a later point(for example at the next :term:`bytecode` "
"instruction). This has consequences:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It makes little sense to catch synchronous errors like :const:`SIGFPE` or :"
"const:`SIGSEGV` that are caused by an invalid operation in C code.  Python "
"will return from the signal handler to the C code, which is likely to raise "
"the same signal again, causing Python to apparently hang.  From Python 3.3 "
"onwards, you can use the :mod:`faulthandler` module to report on synchronous "
"errors."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A long-running calculation implemented purely in C (such as regular "
"expression matching on a large body of text) may run uninterrupted for an "
"arbitrary amount of time, regardless of any signals received.  The Python "
"signal handlers will be called when the calculation finishes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the handler raises an exception, it will be raised \"out of thin air\" in "
"the main thread. See the :ref:`note below <handlers-and-exceptions>` for a "
"discussion."
msgstr ""

msgid "Signals and threads"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Python signal handlers are always executed in the main Python thread of the "
"main interpreter, even if the signal was received in another thread.  This "
"means that signals can't be used as a means of inter-thread communication.  "
"You can use the synchronization primitives from the :mod:`threading` module "
"instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Besides, only the main thread of the main interpreter is allowed to set a "
"new signal handler."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the first approach, we read the data out of the fd's buffer, and the byte "

"run into a problem: generally the fd will have a limited amount of buffer "
"space, and if too many signals arrive too quickly, then the buffer may "
"become full, and some signals may be lost. If you use this approach, then "
"you should set ``warn_on_full_buffer=True``, which will at least cause a "
"warning to be printed to stderr when signals are lost."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the second approach, we use the wakeup fd *only* for wakeups, and ignore "
"the actual byte values. In this case, all we care about is whether the fd's "
"buffer is empty or non-empty; a full buffer doesn't indicate a problem at "
"all. If you use this approach, then you should set "
"``warn_on_full_buffer=False``, so that your users are not confused by "
