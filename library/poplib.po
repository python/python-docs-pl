msgid ":mod:`poplib` --- POP3 protocol client"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/poplib.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module defines a class, :class:`POP3`, which encapsulates a connection "
"to a POP3 server and implements the protocol as defined in :rfc:`1939`. The :"
"class:`POP3` class supports both the minimal and optional command sets from :"
"rfc:`1939`. The :class:`POP3` class also supports the ``STLS`` command "
"introduced in :rfc:`2595` to enable encrypted communication on an already "
"established connection."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Additionally, this module provides a class :class:`POP3_SSL`, which provides "
"support for connecting to POP3 servers that use SSL as an underlying "
"protocol layer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that POP3, though widely supported, is obsolescent.  The implementation "
"quality of POP3 servers varies widely, and too many are quite poor. If your "
"mailserver supports IMAP, you would be better off using the :class:`imaplib."
"IMAP4` class, as IMAP servers tend to be better implemented."
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`Availability <availability>`: not Emscripten, not WASI."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module does not work or is not available on WebAssembly platforms "
"``wasm32-emscripten`` and ``wasm32-wasi``. See :ref:`wasm-availability` for "
"more information."
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`poplib` module provides two classes:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This class implements the actual POP3 protocol.  The connection is created "
"when the instance is initialized. If *port* is omitted, the standard POP3 "
"port (110) is used. The optional *timeout* parameter specifies a timeout in "
"seconds for the connection attempt (if not specified, the global default "
"timeout setting will be used)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``poplib.connect`` with arguments "
"``self``, ``host``, ``port``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``poplib.putline`` with arguments "
"``self``, ``line``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All commands will raise an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``poplib."
"putline`` with arguments ``self`` and ``line``, where ``line`` is the bytes "
"about to be sent to the remote host."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the *timeout* parameter is set to be zero, it will raise a :class:"
"`ValueError` to prevent the creation of a non-blocking socket."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a subclass of :class:`POP3` that connects to the server over an SSL "
"encrypted socket.  If *port* is not specified, 995, the standard POP3-over-"
"SSL port is used.  *timeout* works as in the :class:`POP3` constructor. "
"*context* is an optional :class:`ssl.SSLContext` object which allows "
"bundling SSL configuration options, certificates and private keys into a "
"single (potentially long-lived) structure.  Please read :ref:`ssl-security` "
"for best practices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*keyfile* and *certfile* are a legacy alternative to *context* - they can "
"point to PEM-formatted private key and certificate chain files, "
"respectively, for the SSL connection."
msgstr ""

msgid "*context* parameter added."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The class now supports hostname check with :attr:`ssl.SSLContext."
"check_hostname` and *Server Name Indication* (see :data:`ssl.HAS_SNI`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*keyfile* and *certfile* are deprecated in favor of *context*. Please use :"
"meth:`ssl.SSLContext.load_cert_chain` instead, or let :func:`ssl."
"create_default_context` select the system's trusted CA certificates for you."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All POP3 commands are represented by methods of the same name, in lowercase; "
"most return the response text sent by the server."
msgstr ""

msgid "A :class:`POP3` instance has the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the instance's debugging level.  This controls the amount of debugging "
"output printed.  The default, ``0``, produces no debugging output.  A value "
"of ``1`` produces a moderate amount of debugging output, generally a single "
"line per request.  A value of ``2`` or higher produces the maximum amount of "
"debugging output, logging each line sent and received on the control "
"connection."
