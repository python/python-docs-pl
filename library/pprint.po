msgid ":mod:`!pprint` --- Data pretty printer"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/pprint.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`pprint` module provides a capability to \"pretty-print\" arbitrary "
"Python data structures in a form which can be used as input to the "
"interpreter. If the formatted structures include objects which are not "
"fundamental Python types, the representation may not be loadable.  This may "
"be the case if objects such as files, sockets or classes are included, as "
"well as many other objects which are not representable as Python literals."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The formatted representation keeps objects on a single line if it can, and "
"breaks them onto multiple lines if they don't fit within the allowed width, "
"adjustable by the *width* parameter defaulting to 80 characters."
msgstr ""

msgid "Dictionaries are sorted by key before the display is computed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support for pretty-printing :class:`types.SimpleNamespace`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support for pretty-printing :class:`dataclasses.dataclass`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Functions"
msgstr "Zadania"

msgid ""
"Prints the formatted representation of *object*, followed by a newline. This "
"function may be used in the interactive interpreter instead of the :func:"
"`print` function for inspecting values. Tip: you can reassign ``print = "
"pprint.pp`` for use within a scope."
msgstr ""

msgid "Parameters"
msgstr "parametry"

msgid "The object to be printed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A file-like object to which the output will be written by calling its :meth:"
"`!write` method. If ``None`` (the default), :data:`sys.stdout` is used."
msgstr ""

msgid "The amount of indentation added for each nesting level."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The desired maximum number of characters per line in the output. If a "
"structure cannot be formatted within the width constraint, a best effort "
"will be made."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The number of nesting levels which may be printed. If the data structure "
"being printed is too deep, the next contained level is replaced by ``...``. "
"If ``None`` (the default), there is no constraint on the depth of the "
"objects being formatted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Control the way long :term:`sequences <sequence>` are formatted. If "
"``False`` (the default), each item of a sequence will be formatted on a "
"separate line, otherwise as many items as will fit within the *width* will "
"be formatted on each output line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``True``, dictionaries will be formatted with their keys sorted, "
"otherwise they will be displayed in insertion order (the default)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If ``True``, integers will be formatted with the ``_`` character for a "
"thousands separator, otherwise underscores are not displayed (the default)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alias for :func:`~pprint.pp` with *sort_dicts* set to ``True`` by default, "
"which would automatically sort the dictionaries' keys, you might want to "
"use :func:`~pprint.pp` instead where it is ``False`` by default."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the formatted representation of *object* as a string.  *indent*, "
"*width*, *depth*, *compact*, *sort_dicts* and *underscore_numbers* are "
"passed to the :class:`PrettyPrinter` constructor as formatting parameters "
"and their meanings are as described in the documentation above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Determine if the formatted representation of *object* is \"readable\", or "
"can be used to reconstruct the value using :func:`eval`.  This always "
"returns ``False`` for recursive objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Determine if *object* requires a recursive representation.  This function is "
"subject to the same limitations as noted in :func:`saferepr` below and may "
"raise an :exc:`RecursionError` if it fails to detect a recursive object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a string representation of *object*, protected against recursion in "
"some common data structures, namely instances of :class:`dict`, :class:"
"`list` and :class:`tuple` or subclasses whose ``__repr__`` has not been "
"overridden.  If the representation of object exposes a recursive entry, the "
"recursive reference will be represented as ``<Recursion on typename with "
"id=number>``.  The representation is not otherwise formatted."
msgstr ""

msgid "PrettyPrinter Objects"
msgstr ""

msgid "Construct a :class:`PrettyPrinter` instance."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Arguments have the same meaning as for :func:`~pprint.pp`. Note that they "
"are in a different order, and that *sort_dicts* defaults to ``True``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *compact* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *sort_dicts* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *underscore_numbers* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid "No longer attempts to write to :data:`!sys.stdout` if it is ``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`PrettyPrinter` instances have the following methods:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the formatted representation of *object*.  This takes into account "
"the options passed to the :class:`PrettyPrinter` constructor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Print the formatted representation of *object* on the configured stream, "
"followed by a newline."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following methods provide the implementations for the corresponding "
"functions of the same names.  Using these methods on an instance is slightly "
"more efficient since new :class:`PrettyPrinter` objects don't need to be "
"created."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Determine if the formatted representation of the object is \"readable,\" or "
"can be used to reconstruct the value using :func:`eval`.  Note that this "
"returns ``False`` for recursive objects.  If the *depth* parameter of the :"
"class:`PrettyPrinter` is set and the object is deeper than allowed, this "
"returns ``False``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Determine if the object requires a recursive representation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This method is provided as a hook to allow subclasses to modify the way "
"objects are converted to strings.  The default implementation uses the "
"internals of the :func:`saferepr` implementation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns three values: the formatted version of *object* as a string, a flag "
"indicating whether the result is readable, and a flag indicating whether "
"recursion was detected.  The first argument is the object to be presented.  "
"The second is a dictionary which contains the :func:`id` of objects that are "
"part of the current presentation context (direct and indirect containers for "
"*object* that are affecting the presentation) as the keys; if an object "
"needs to be presented which is already represented in *context*, the third "
"return value should be ``True``.  Recursive calls to the :meth:`.format` "
"method should add additional entries for containers to this dictionary.  The "
"third argument, *maxlevels*, gives the requested limit to recursion; this "
"will be ``0`` if there is no requested limit.  This argument should be "
"passed unmodified to recursive calls. The fourth argument, *level*, gives "
"the current level; recursive calls should be passed a value less than that "
"of the current call."
