msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/random.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various "
"distributions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For integers, there is uniform selection from a range. For sequences, there "
"is uniform selection of a random element, a function to generate a random "
"permutation of a list in-place, and a function for random sampling without "
"replacement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On the real line, there are functions to compute uniform, normal (Gaussian), "
"lognormal, negative exponential, gamma, and beta distributions. For "
"generating distributions of angles, the von Mises distribution is available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Almost all module functions depend on the basic function :func:`.random`, "
"which generates a random float uniformly in the half-open range ``0.0 <= X < "
"1.0``. Python uses the Mersenne Twister as the core generator.  It produces "
"53-bit precision floats and has a period of 2\\*\\*19937-1.  The underlying "
"implementation in C is both fast and threadsafe.  The Mersenne Twister is "
"one of the most extensively tested random number generators in existence.  "
"However, being completely deterministic, it is not suitable for all "
"purposes, and is completely unsuitable for cryptographic purposes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The functions supplied by this module are actually bound methods of a hidden "
"instance of the :class:`random.Random` class.  You can instantiate your own "
"instances of :class:`Random` to get generators that don't share state."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Class :class:`Random` can also be subclassed if you want to use a different "
"basic generator of your own devising: in that case, override the :meth:"
"`~Random.random`, :meth:`~Random.seed`, :meth:`~Random.getstate`, and :meth:"
"`~Random.setstate` methods. Optionally, a new generator can supply a :meth:"
"`~Random.getrandbits` method --- this allows :meth:`randrange` to produce "
"selections over an arbitrarily large range."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`random` module also provides the :class:`SystemRandom` class which "
"uses the system function :func:`os.urandom` to generate random numbers from "
"sources provided by the operating system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The pseudo-random generators of this module should not be used for security "
"purposes.  For security or cryptographic uses, see the :mod:`secrets` module."

"If *a* is omitted or ``None``, the current system time is used.  If "

msgid ""
"With version 2 (the default), a :class:`str`, :class:`bytes`, or :class:"
"`bytearray` object gets converted to an :class:`int` and all of its bits are "
"used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With version 1 (provided for reproducing random sequences from older "
"versions of Python), the algorithm for :class:`str` and :class:`bytes` "
"generates a narrower range of seeds."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Moved to the version 2 scheme which uses all of the bits in a string seed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgid ""
"Return an object capturing the current internal state of the generator.  "
"This object can be passed to :func:`setstate` to restore the state."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*state* should have been obtained from a previous call to :func:`getstate`, "
"and :func:`setstate` restores the internal state of the generator to what it "

msgid "Functions for integers"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a randomly selected element from ``range(start, stop, step)``.  This "
"is equivalent to ``choice(range(start, stop, step))``, but doesn't actually "
"build a range object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The positional argument pattern matches that of :func:`range`.  Keyword "
"arguments should not be used because the function may use them in unexpected "
"ways."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":meth:`randrange` is more sophisticated about producing equally distributed "
"values.  Formerly it used a style like ``int(random()*n)`` which could "
"produce slightly uneven distributions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The automatic conversion of non-integer types to equivalent integers is "
"deprecated.  Currently ``randrange(10.0)`` is losslessly converted to "
"``randrange(10)``.  In the future, this will raise a :exc:`TypeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The exception raised for non-integral values such as ``randrange(10.5)`` or "
"``randrange('10')`` will be changed from :exc:`ValueError` to :exc:"
"`TypeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a random integer *N* such that ``a <= N <= b``.  Alias for "
"``randrange(a, b+1)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a non-negative Python integer with *k* random bits. This method is "
"supplied with the MersenneTwister generator and some other generators may "
"also provide it as an optional part of the API. When available, :meth:"
"`getrandbits` enables :meth:`randrange` to handle arbitrarily large ranges."
msgstr ""

msgid "This method now accepts zero for *k*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Functions for sequences"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a random element from the non-empty sequence *seq*. If *seq* is "
"empty, raises :exc:`IndexError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a *k* sized list of elements chosen from the *population* with "
"replacement. If the *population* is empty, raises :exc:`IndexError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a *weights* sequence is specified, selections are made according to the "
"relative weights.  Alternatively, if a *cum_weights* sequence is given, the "
"selections are made according to the cumulative weights (perhaps computed "
"using :func:`itertools.accumulate`).  For example, the relative weights "
"``[10, 5, 30, 5]`` are equivalent to the cumulative weights ``[10, 15, 45, "
"50]``.  Internally, the relative weights are converted to cumulative weights "
"before making selections, so supplying the cumulative weights saves work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If neither *weights* nor *cum_weights* are specified, selections are made "
"with equal probability.  If a weights sequence is supplied, it must be the "
"same length as the *population* sequence.  It is a :exc:`TypeError` to "
"specify both *weights* and *cum_weights*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *weights* or *cum_weights* can use any numeric type that interoperates "
"with the :class:`float` values returned by :func:`random` (that includes "
"integers, floats, and fractions but excludes decimals).  Weights are assumed "
"to be non-negative and finite.  A :exc:`ValueError` is raised if all weights "
"are zero."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a given seed, the :func:`choices` function with equal weighting "
"typically produces a different sequence than repeated calls to :func:"
"`choice`.  The algorithm used by :func:`choices` uses floating point "
"arithmetic for internal consistency and speed.  The algorithm used by :func:"
"`choice` defaults to integer arithmetic with repeated selections to avoid "
"small biases from round-off error."
msgstr ""

msgid "Raises a :exc:`ValueError` if all weights are zero."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shuffle the sequence *x* in place."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To shuffle an immutable sequence and return a new shuffled list, use "
"``sample(x, k=len(x))`` instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Note that even for small ``len(x)``, the total number of permutations of *x* "
"can quickly grow larger than the period of most random number generators. "
"This implies that most permutations of a long sequence can never be "
"generated.  For example, a sequence of length 2080 is the largest that can "
"fit within the period of the Mersenne Twister random number generator."
msgstr ""

msgid "The optional parameter *random*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a *k* length list of unique elements chosen from the population "
"sequence.  Used for random sampling without replacement."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Returns a new list containing elements from the population while leaving the "
"original population unchanged.  The resulting list is in selection order so "
"that all sub-slices will also be valid random samples.  This allows raffle "
"winners (the sample) to be partitioned into grand prize and second place "
"winners (the subslices)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Members of the population need not be :term:`hashable` or unique.  If the "
"population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible selection in "
"the sample."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Repeated elements can be specified one at a time or with the optional "
"keyword-only *counts* parameter.  For example, ``sample(['red', 'blue'], "
"counts=[4, 2], k=5)`` is equivalent to ``sample(['red', 'red', 'red', 'red', "
"'blue', 'blue'], k=5)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To choose a sample from a range of integers, use a :func:`range` object as "
"an argument.  This is especially fast and space efficient for sampling from "
"a large population:  ``sample(range(10000000), k=60)``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the sample size is larger than the population size, a :exc:`ValueError` "
"is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *counts* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *population* must be a sequence.  Automatic conversion of sets to lists "
"is no longer supported."
msgstr ""

msgid "Real-valued distributions"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following functions generate specific real-valued distributions. "
"Function parameters are named after the corresponding variables in the "
"distribution's equation, as used in common mathematical practice; most of "
"these equations can be found in any statistics text."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the next random floating point number in the range ``0.0 <= X < 1.0``"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a random floating point number *N* such that ``a <= N <= b`` for ``a "
"<= b`` and ``b <= N <= a`` for ``b < a``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The end-point value ``b`` may or may not be included in the range depending "
"on floating-point rounding in the equation ``a + (b-a) * random()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a random floating point number *N* such that ``low <= N <= high`` and "
"with the specified *mode* between those bounds.  The *low* and *high* bounds "
"default to zero and one.  The *mode* argument defaults to the midpoint "
"between the bounds, giving a symmetric distribution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Beta distribution.  Conditions on the parameters are ``alpha > 0`` and "
"``beta > 0``. Returned values range between 0 and 1."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Exponential distribution.  *lambd* is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It "
"should be nonzero.  (The parameter would be called \"lambda\", but that is a "
"reserved word in Python.)  Returned values range from 0 to positive infinity "
"if *lambd* is positive, and from negative infinity to 0 if *lambd* is "
"negative."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Gamma distribution.  (*Not* the gamma function!)  Conditions on the "
"parameters are ``alpha > 0`` and ``beta > 0``."
msgstr ""

msgid "The probability distribution function is::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normal distribution, also called the Gaussian distribution.  *mu* is the "
"mean, and *sigma* is the standard deviation.  This is slightly faster than "
"the :func:`normalvariate` function defined below."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multithreading note:  When two threads call this function simultaneously, it "
"is possible that they will receive the same return value.  This can be "
"avoided in three ways. 1) Have each thread use a different instance of the "
"random number generator. 2) Put locks around all calls. 3) Use the slower, "
"but thread-safe :func:`normalvariate` function instead."
msgstr ""

msgid "*mu* and *sigma* now have default arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Log normal distribution.  If you take the natural logarithm of this "
"distribution, you'll get a normal distribution with mean *mu* and standard "
"deviation *sigma*.  *mu* can have any value, and *sigma* must be greater "
"than zero."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Normal distribution.  *mu* is the mean, and *sigma* is the standard "
"deviation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*mu* is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2\\*\\ *pi*, and "
"*kappa* is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or equal "
"to zero.  If *kappa* is equal to zero, this distribution reduces to a "
"uniform random angle over the range 0 to 2\\*\\ *pi*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Pareto distribution.  *alpha* is the shape parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Weibull distribution.  *alpha* is the scale parameter and *beta* is the "
"shape parameter."

"class:`bytearray`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Class that uses the :func:`os.urandom` function for generating random "
"numbers from sources provided by the operating system. Not available on all "

"The default :func:`.random` returns multiples of 2⁻⁵³ in the range *0.0 ≤ x "
"< 1.0*.  All such numbers are evenly spaced and are exactly representable as "
"Python floats.  However, many other representable floats in that interval "

msgid ""
"The following recipe takes a different approach.  All floats in the interval "

"geometric distribution where exponents smaller than *-53* occur half as "
