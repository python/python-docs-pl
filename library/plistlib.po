msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides an interface for reading and writing the \"property "
"list\" files used by Apple, primarily on macOS and iOS. This module supports "
"both binary and XML plist files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The property list (``.plist``) file format is a simple serialization "
"supporting basic object types, like dictionaries, lists, numbers and "
"strings.  Usually the top level object is a dictionary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To write out and to parse a plist file, use the :func:`dump` and :func:"
"`load` functions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To work with plist data in bytes objects, use :func:`dumps` and :func:"
"`loads`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Values can be strings, integers, floats, booleans, tuples, lists, "
"dictionaries (but only with string keys), :class:`bytes`, :class:`bytearray` "
"or :class:`datetime.datetime` objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "New API, old API deprecated.  Support for binary format plists added."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Support added for reading and writing :class:`UID` tokens in binary plists "
"as used by NSKeyedArchiver and NSKeyedUnarchiver."
msgstr ""

msgid "Old API removed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Apple's documentation of the file format."
msgstr ""

msgid "This module defines the following functions:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Read a plist file. *fp* should be a readable and binary file object. Return "
"the unpacked root object (which usually is a dictionary)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *fmt* is the format of the file and the following values are valid:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":data:`None`: Autodetect the file format"
msgstr ""

msgid ":data:`FMT_XML`: XML file format"
msgstr ""

msgid ":data:`FMT_BINARY`: Binary plist format"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *dict_type* is the type used for dictionaries that are read from the "
"plist file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"XML data for the :data:`FMT_XML` format is parsed using the Expat parser "
"from :mod:`xml.parsers.expat` -- see its documentation for possible "
"exceptions on ill-formed XML.  Unknown elements will simply be ignored by "
"the plist parser."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The parser for the binary format raises :exc:`InvalidFileException` when the "
"file cannot be parsed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Load a plist from a bytes object. See :func:`load` for an explanation of the "
"keyword arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Write *value* to a plist file. *Fp* should be a writable, binary file object."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *fmt* argument specifies the format of the plist file and can be one of "
"the following values:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":data:`FMT_XML`: XML formatted plist file"
msgstr ""

msgid ":data:`FMT_BINARY`: Binary formatted plist file"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When *sort_keys* is true (the default) the keys for dictionaries will be "
"written to the plist in sorted order, otherwise they will be written in the "
"iteration order of the dictionary."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When *skipkeys* is false (the default) the function raises :exc:`TypeError` "
"when a key of a dictionary is not a string, otherwise such keys are skipped."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A :exc:`TypeError` will be raised if the object is of an unsupported type or "
"a container that contains objects of unsupported types."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An :exc:`OverflowError` will be raised for integer values that cannot be "
"represented in (binary) plist files."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return *value* as a plist-formatted bytes object. See the documentation for :"
"func:`dump` for an explanation of the keyword arguments of this function."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following classes are available:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Wraps an :class:`int`.  This is used when reading or writing NSKeyedArchiver "
"encoded data, which contains UID (see PList manual)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It has one attribute, :attr:`data`, which can be used to retrieve the int "
"value of the UID.  :attr:`data` must be in the range ``0 <= data < 2**64``."
msgstr ""
