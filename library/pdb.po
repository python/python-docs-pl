msgid ":mod:`pdb` --- The Python Debugger"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/pdb.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module :mod:`pdb` defines an interactive source code debugger for Python "
"programs.  It supports setting (conditional) breakpoints and single stepping "
"at the source line level, inspection of stack frames, source code listing, "
"and evaluation of arbitrary Python code in the context of any stack frame.  "
"It also supports post-mortem debugging and can be called under program "
"control."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The debugger is extensible -- it is actually defined as the class :class:"
"`Pdb`. This is currently undocumented but easily understood by reading the "
"source.  The extension interface uses the modules :mod:`bdb` and :mod:`cmd`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Module :mod:`faulthandler`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Used to dump Python tracebacks explicitly, on a fault, after a timeout, or "
"on a user signal."
msgstr ""

msgid "Module :mod:`traceback`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Standard interface to extract, format and print stack traces of Python "
"programs."
msgstr ""

msgid "The typical usage to break into the debugger is to insert::"
msgstr ""

msgid "Or::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"at the location you want to break into the debugger, and then run the "
"program. You can then step through the code following this statement, and "
"continue running without the debugger using the :pdbcmd:`continue` command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The built-in :func:`breakpoint()`, when called with defaults, can be used "
"instead of ``import pdb; pdb.set_trace()``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The debugger's prompt is ``(Pdb)``, which is the indicator that you are in "
"debug mode::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tab-completion via the :mod:`readline` module is available for commands and "
"command arguments, e.g. the current global and local names are offered as "
"arguments of the ``p`` command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also invoke :mod:`pdb` from the command line to debug other "
"scripts.  For example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When invoked as a module, pdb will automatically enter post-mortem debugging "
"if the program being debugged exits abnormally.  After post-mortem debugging "
"(or after normal exit of the program), pdb will restart the program.  "
"Automatic restarting preserves pdb's state (such as breakpoints) and in most "
"cases is more useful than quitting the debugger upon program's exit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``-c`` option is introduced to execute commands as if given in a :file:`."
"pdbrc` file, see :ref:`debugger-commands`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``-m`` option is introduced to execute modules similar to the way ``python -"
"m`` does. As with a script, the debugger will pause execution just before "
"the first line of the module."
msgstr ""

msgid "Typical usage to execute a statement under control of the debugger is::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The typical usage to inspect a crashed program is::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The module defines the following functions; each enters the debugger in a "
"slightly different way:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Execute the *statement* (given as a string or a code object) under debugger "
"control.  The debugger prompt appears before any code is executed; you can "
"set breakpoints and type :pdbcmd:`continue`, or you can step through the "
"statement using :pdbcmd:`step` or :pdbcmd:`next` (all these commands are "
"explained below).  The optional *globals* and *locals* arguments specify the "
"environment in which the code is executed; by default the dictionary of the "
"module :mod:`__main__` is used.  (See the explanation of the built-in :func:"
"`exec` or :func:`eval` functions.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Evaluate the *expression* (given as a string or a code object) under "
"debugger control.  When :func:`runeval` returns, it returns the value of the "
"*expression*.  Otherwise this function is similar to :func:`run`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Call the *function* (a function or method object, not a string) with the "
"given arguments.  When :func:`runcall` returns, it returns whatever the "
"function call returned.  The debugger prompt appears as soon as the function "
"is entered."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enter the debugger at the calling stack frame.  This is useful to hard-code "
"a breakpoint at a given point in a program, even if the code is not "
"otherwise being debugged (e.g. when an assertion fails).  If given, *header* "
"is printed to the console just before debugging begins."
msgstr ""

msgid "The keyword-only argument *header*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enter post-mortem debugging of the given *traceback* object.  If no "
"*traceback* is given, it uses the one of the exception that is currently "
"being handled (an exception must be being handled if the default is to be "
"used)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enter post-mortem debugging of the traceback found in :data:`sys."
"last_traceback`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``run*`` functions and :func:`set_trace` are aliases for instantiating "
"the :class:`Pdb` class and calling the method of the same name.  If you want "
"to access further features, you have to do this yourself:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":class:`Pdb` is the debugger class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *completekey*, *stdin* and *stdout* arguments are passed to the "
"underlying :class:`cmd.Cmd` class; see the description there."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *skip* argument, if given, must be an iterable of glob-style module name "
"patterns.  The debugger will not step into frames that originate in a module "
"that matches one of these patterns. [1]_"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, Pdb sets a handler for the SIGINT signal (which is sent when the "
"user presses :kbd:`Ctrl-C` on the console) when you give a :pdbcmd:"
"`continue` command. This allows you to break into the debugger again by "
"pressing :kbd:`Ctrl-C`.  If you want Pdb not to touch the SIGINT handler, "
"set *nosigint* to true."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *readrc* argument defaults to true and controls whether Pdb will load ."
"pdbrc files from the filesystem."
msgstr ""

msgid "Example call to enable tracing with *skip*::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raises an :ref:`auditing event <auditing>` ``pdb.Pdb`` with no arguments."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *skip* argument."

msgid ""
"The *nosigint* argument.  Previously, a SIGINT handler was never set by Pdb."
msgstr ""

msgid "The *readrc* argument."
msgstr ""

msgid "See the documentation for the functions explained above."
msgstr ""

msgid "Debugger Commands"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The commands recognized by the debugger are listed below.  Most commands can "
"be abbreviated to one or two letters as indicated; e.g. ``h(elp)`` means "
"that either ``h`` or ``help`` can be used to enter the help command (but not "
"``he`` or ``hel``, nor ``H`` or ``Help`` or ``HELP``).  Arguments to "
"commands must be separated by whitespace (spaces or tabs).  Optional "
"arguments are enclosed in square brackets (``[]``) in the command syntax; "
"the square brackets must not be typed.  Alternatives in the command syntax "
"are separated by a vertical bar (``|``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Entering a blank line repeats the last command entered.  Exception: if the "
"last command was a :pdbcmd:`list` command, the next 11 lines are listed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Commands that the debugger doesn't recognize are assumed to be Python "
"statements and are executed in the context of the program being debugged.  "
"Python statements can also be prefixed with an exclamation point (``!``).  "
"This is a powerful way to inspect the program being debugged; it is even "
"possible to change a variable or call a function.  When an exception occurs "
"in such a statement, the exception name is printed but the debugger's state "
"is not changed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The debugger supports :ref:`aliases <debugger-aliases>`.  Aliases can have "
"parameters which allows one a certain level of adaptability to the context "
"under examination."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multiple commands may be entered on a single line, separated by ``;;``.  (A "
"single ``;`` is not used as it is the separator for multiple commands in a "
"line that is passed to the Python parser.)  No intelligence is applied to "
"separating the commands; the input is split at the first ``;;`` pair, even "
"if it is in the middle of a quoted string. A workaround for strings with "
"double semicolons is to use implicit string concatenation ``';'';'`` or ``\";"
"\"\";\"``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To set a temporary global variable, use a *convenience variable*. A "
"*convenience variable* is a variable whose name starts with ``$``.  For "
"example, ``$foo = 1`` sets a global variable ``$foo`` which you can use in "
"the debugger session.  The *convenience variables* are cleared when the "
"program resumes execution so it's less likely to interfere with your program "
"compared to using normal variables like ``foo = 1``."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are three preset *convenience variables*:"
msgstr ""

msgid "``$_frame``: the current frame you are debugging"
msgstr ""

msgid "``$_retval``: the return value if the frame is returning"
msgstr ""

msgid "``$_exception``: the exception if the frame is raising an exception"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a file :file:`.pdbrc` exists in the user's home directory or in the "
"current directory, it is read with ``'utf-8'`` encoding and executed as if "
"it had been typed at the debugger prompt.  This is particularly useful for "
"aliases.  If both files exist, the one in the home directory is read first "
"and aliases defined there can be overridden by the local file."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":file:`.pdbrc` is now read with ``'utf-8'`` encoding. Previously, it was "
"read with the system locale encoding."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":file:`.pdbrc` can now contain commands that continue debugging, such as :"
"pdbcmd:`continue` or :pdbcmd:`next`.  Previously, these commands had no "
"effect."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Without argument, print the list of available commands.  With a *command* as "
"argument, print help about that command.  ``help pdb`` displays the full "
"documentation (the docstring of the :mod:`pdb` module).  Since the *command* "
"argument must be an identifier, ``help exec`` must be entered to get help on "
"the ``!`` command."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Print a stack trace, with the most recent frame at the bottom.  An arrow "
"(``>``) indicates the current frame, which determines the context of most "
"commands."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Move the current frame *count* (default one) levels down in the stack trace "
"(to a newer frame)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Move the current frame *count* (default one) levels up in the stack trace "
"(to an older frame)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With a *lineno* argument, set a break there in the current file.  With a "
"*function* argument, set a break at the first executable statement within "
"that function.  The line number may be prefixed with a filename and a colon, "
"to specify a breakpoint in another file (probably one that hasn't been "
"loaded yet).  The file is searched on :data:`sys.path`.  Note that each "
"breakpoint is assigned a number to which all the other breakpoint commands "
"refer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If a second argument is present, it is an expression which must evaluate to "
"true before the breakpoint is honored."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Without argument, list all breaks, including for each breakpoint, the number "
"of times that breakpoint has been hit, the current ignore count, and the "
"associated condition if any."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Temporary breakpoint, which is removed automatically when it is first hit. "
"The arguments are the same as for :pdbcmd:`break`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With a *filename:lineno* argument, clear all the breakpoints at this line. "
"With a space separated list of breakpoint numbers, clear those breakpoints. "
"Without argument, clear all breaks (but first ask confirmation)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Disable the breakpoints given as a space separated list of breakpoint "
"numbers.  Disabling a breakpoint means it cannot cause the program to stop "
"execution, but unlike clearing a breakpoint, it remains in the list of "
"breakpoints and can be (re-)enabled."
msgstr ""

msgid "Enable the breakpoints specified."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the ignore count for the given breakpoint number.  If *count* is "
"omitted, the ignore count is set to 0.  A breakpoint becomes active when the "
"ignore count is zero.  When non-zero, the *count* is decremented each time "
"the breakpoint is reached and the breakpoint is not disabled and any "
"associated condition evaluates to true."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set a new *condition* for the breakpoint, an expression which must evaluate "
"to true before the breakpoint is honored.  If *condition* is absent, any "
"existing condition is removed; i.e., the breakpoint is made unconditional."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Specify a list of commands for breakpoint number *bpnumber*.  The commands "
"themselves appear on the following lines.  Type a line containing just "
"``end`` to terminate the commands. An example::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To remove all commands from a breakpoint, type ``commands`` and follow it "
"immediately with ``end``; that is, give no commands."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With no *bpnumber* argument, ``commands`` refers to the last breakpoint set."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use breakpoint commands to start your program up again.  Simply use "
"the :pdbcmd:`continue` command, or :pdbcmd:`step`, or any other command that "
"resumes execution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Specifying any command resuming execution (currently :pdbcmd:`continue`, :"
"pdbcmd:`step`, :pdbcmd:`next`, :pdbcmd:`return`, :pdbcmd:`jump`, :pdbcmd:"
"`quit` and their abbreviations) terminates the command list (as if that "
"command was immediately followed by end). This is because any time you "
"resume execution (even with a simple next or step), you may encounter "
"another breakpoint—which could have its own command list, leading to "
"ambiguities about which list to execute."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you use the ``silent`` command in the command list, the usual message "
"about stopping at a breakpoint is not printed.  This may be desirable for "
"breakpoints that are to print a specific message and then continue.  If none "
"of the other commands print anything, you see no sign that the breakpoint "
"was reached."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Execute the current line, stop at the first possible occasion (either in a "
"function that is called or on the next line in the current function)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Continue execution until the next line in the current function is reached or "
"it returns.  (The difference between :pdbcmd:`next` and :pdbcmd:`step` is "
"that :pdbcmd:`step` stops inside a called function, while :pdbcmd:`next` "
"executes called functions at (nearly) full speed, only stopping at the next "
"line in the current function.)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Without argument, continue execution until the line with a number greater "
"than the current one is reached."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With *lineno*, continue execution until a line with a number greater or "
"equal to *lineno* is reached.  In both cases, also stop when the current "
"frame returns."
msgstr ""

msgid "Allow giving an explicit line number."
msgstr ""

msgid "Continue execution until the current function returns."
msgstr ""

msgid "Continue execution, only stop when a breakpoint is encountered."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set the next line that will be executed.  Only available in the bottom-most "
"frame.  This lets you jump back and execute code again, or jump forward to "
"skip code that you don't want to run."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It should be noted that not all jumps are allowed -- for instance it is not "
"possible to jump into the middle of a :keyword:`for` loop or out of a :"
"keyword:`finally` clause."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"List source code for the current file.  Without arguments, list 11 lines "
"around the current line or continue the previous listing.  With ``.`` as "
"argument, list 11 lines around the current line.  With one argument, list 11 "
"lines around at that line.  With two arguments, list the given range; if the "
"second argument is less than the first, it is interpreted as a count."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The current line in the current frame is indicated by ``->``.  If an "

msgstr ""

msgid "Evaluate *expression* in the current context and print its value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``print()`` can also be used, but is not a debugger command --- this "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Display evaluates *expression* and compares to the result of the previous "
