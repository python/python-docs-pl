msgid ":mod:`lzma` --- Compression using the LZMA algorithm"
msgstr ""

msgid "**Source code:** :source:`Lib/lzma.py`"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module provides classes and convenience functions for compressing and "
"decompressing data using the LZMA compression algorithm. Also included is a "
"file interface supporting the ``.xz`` and legacy ``.lzma`` file formats used "
"by the :program:`xz` utility, as well as raw compressed streams."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The interface provided by this module is very similar to that of the :mod:"
"`bz2` module. Note that :class:`LZMAFile` and :class:`bz2.BZ2File` are *not* "
"thread-safe, so if you need to use a single :class:`LZMAFile` instance from "
"multiple threads, it is necessary to protect it with a lock."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This exception is raised when an error occurs during compression or "
"decompression, or while initializing the compressor/decompressor state."
msgstr ""

msgid "Reading and writing compressed files"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Open an LZMA-compressed file in binary or text mode, returning a :term:`file "
"object`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *filename* argument can be either an actual file name (given as a :class:"
"`str`, :class:`bytes` or :term:`path-like <path-like object>` object), in "
"which case the named file is opened, or it can be an existing file object to "
"read from or write to."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *mode* argument can be any of ``\"r\"``, ``\"rb\"``, ``\"w\"``, "
"``\"wb\"``, ``\"x\"``, ``\"xb\"``, ``\"a\"`` or ``\"ab\"`` for binary mode, "
"or ``\"rt\"``, ``\"wt\"``, ``\"xt\"``, or ``\"at\"`` for text mode. The "
"default is ``\"rb\"``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When opening a file for reading, the *format* and *filters* arguments have "
"the same meanings as for :class:`LZMADecompressor`. In this case, the "
"*check* and *preset* arguments should not be used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When opening a file for writing, the *format*, *check*, *preset* and "
"*filters* arguments have the same meanings as for :class:`LZMACompressor`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For binary mode, this function is equivalent to the :class:`LZMAFile` "
"constructor: ``LZMAFile(filename, mode, ...)``. In this case, the "
"*encoding*, *errors* and *newline* arguments must not be provided."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For text mode, a :class:`LZMAFile` object is created, and wrapped in an :"
"class:`io.TextIOWrapper` instance with the specified encoding, error "
"handling behavior, and line ending(s)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support for the ``\"x\"``, ``\"xb\"`` and ``\"xt\"`` modes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Accepts a :term:`path-like object`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Open an LZMA-compressed file in binary mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"An :class:`LZMAFile` can wrap an already-open :term:`file object`, or "
"operate directly on a named file. The *filename* argument specifies either "
"the file object to wrap, or the name of the file to open (as a :class:"
"`str`, :class:`bytes` or :term:`path-like <path-like object>` object). When "
"wrapping an existing file object, the wrapped file will not be closed when "
"the :class:`LZMAFile` is closed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *mode* argument can be either ``\"r\"`` for reading (default), ``\"w\"`` "
"for overwriting, ``\"x\"`` for exclusive creation, or ``\"a\"`` for "
"appending. These can equivalently be given as ``\"rb\"``, ``\"wb\"``, "
"``\"xb\"`` and ``\"ab\"`` respectively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *filename* is a file object (rather than an actual file name), a mode of "
"``\"w\"`` does not truncate the file, and is instead equivalent to ``\"a\"``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When opening a file for reading, the input file may be the concatenation of "
"multiple separate compressed streams. These are transparently decoded as a "
"single logical stream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`LZMAFile` supports all the members specified by :class:`io."
"BufferedIOBase`, except for :meth:`detach` and :meth:`truncate`. Iteration "
"and the :keyword:`with` statement are supported."
msgstr ""

msgid "The following method is also provided:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return buffered data without advancing the file position. At least one byte "
"of data will be returned, unless EOF has been reached. The exact number of "
"bytes returned is unspecified (the *size* argument is ignored)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While calling :meth:`peek` does not change the file position of the :class:"
"`LZMAFile`, it may change the position of the underlying file object (e.g. "
"if the :class:`LZMAFile` was constructed by passing a file object for "
"*filename*)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added support for the ``\"x\"`` and ``\"xb\"`` modes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :meth:`~io.BufferedIOBase.read` method now accepts an argument of "
"``None``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compressing and decompressing data in memory"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a compressor object, which can be used to compress data incrementally."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a more convenient way of compressing a single chunk of data, see :func:"
"`compress`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *format* argument specifies what container format should be used. "
"Possible values are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":const:`FORMAT_XZ`: The ``.xz`` container format."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is the default format."
msgstr ""

msgid ":const:`FORMAT_ALONE`: The legacy ``.lzma`` container format."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This format is more limited than ``.xz`` -- it does not support integrity "
"checks or multiple filters."
msgstr ""

msgid ":const:`FORMAT_RAW`: A raw data stream, not using any container format."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This format specifier does not support integrity checks, and requires that "
"you always specify a custom filter chain (for both compression and "
"decompression). Additionally, data compressed in this manner cannot be "
"decompressed using :const:`FORMAT_AUTO` (see :class:`LZMADecompressor`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *check* argument specifies the type of integrity check to include in the "
"compressed data. This check is used when decompressing, to ensure that the "
"data has not been corrupted. Possible values are:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":const:`CHECK_NONE`: No integrity check. This is the default (and the only "
"acceptable value) for :const:`FORMAT_ALONE` and :const:`FORMAT_RAW`."
msgstr ""

msgid ":const:`CHECK_CRC32`: 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":const:`CHECK_CRC64`: 64-bit Cyclic Redundancy Check. This is the default "
"for :const:`FORMAT_XZ`."
msgstr ""

msgid ":const:`CHECK_SHA256`: 256-bit Secure Hash Algorithm."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the specified check is not supported, an :class:`LZMAError` is raised."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The compression settings can be specified either as a preset compression "
"level (with the *preset* argument), or in detail as a custom filter chain "
"(with the *filters* argument)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *preset* argument (if provided) should be an integer between ``0`` and "
"``9`` (inclusive), optionally OR-ed with the constant :const:"
"`PRESET_EXTREME`. If neither *preset* nor *filters* are given, the default "
"behavior is to use :const:`PRESET_DEFAULT` (preset level ``6``). Higher "
"presets produce smaller output, but make the compression process slower."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In addition to being more CPU-intensive, compression with higher presets "
"also requires much more memory (and produces output that needs more memory "
"to decompress). With preset ``9`` for example, the overhead for an :class:"
"`LZMACompressor` object can be as high as 800 MiB. For this reason, it is "
"generally best to stick with the default preset."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *filters* argument (if provided) should be a filter chain specifier. "
"See :ref:`filter-chain-specs` for details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Compress *data* (a :class:`bytes` object), returning a :class:`bytes` object "
"containing compressed data for at least part of the input. Some of *data* "
"may be buffered internally, for use in later calls to :meth:`compress` and :"
"meth:`flush`. The returned data should be concatenated with the output of "
"any previous calls to :meth:`compress`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finish the compression process, returning a :class:`bytes` object containing "
"any data stored in the compressor's internal buffers."
msgstr ""

msgid "The compressor cannot be used after this method has been called."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Create a decompressor object, which can be used to decompress data "
"incrementally."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a more convenient way of decompressing an entire compressed stream at "
"once, see :func:`decompress`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *format* argument specifies the container format that should be used. "
"The default is :const:`FORMAT_AUTO`, which can decompress both ``.xz`` and "
"``.lzma`` files. Other possible values are :const:`FORMAT_XZ`, :const:"
"`FORMAT_ALONE`, and :const:`FORMAT_RAW`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *memlimit* argument specifies a limit (in bytes) on the amount of memory "
"that the decompressor can use. When this argument is used, decompression "
"will fail with an :class:`LZMAError` if it is not possible to decompress the "
"input within the given memory limit."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The *filters* argument specifies the filter chain that was used to create "
"the stream being decompressed. This argument is required if *format* is :"
"const:`FORMAT_RAW`, but should not be used for other formats. See :ref:"
"`filter-chain-specs` for more information about filter chains."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This class does not transparently handle inputs containing multiple "
"compressed streams, unlike :func:`decompress` and :class:`LZMAFile`. To "
"decompress a multi-stream input with :class:`LZMADecompressor`, you must "
"create a new decompressor for each stream."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Decompress *data* (a :term:`bytes-like object`), returning uncompressed data "
"as bytes. Some of *data* may be buffered internally, for use in later calls "
"to :meth:`decompress`. The returned data should be concatenated with the "
"output of any previous calls to :meth:`decompress`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If *max_length* is nonnegative, returns at most *max_length* bytes of "
"decompressed data. If this limit is reached and further output can be "
"produced, the :attr:`~.needs_input` attribute will be set to ``False``. In "
"this case, the next call to :meth:`~.decompress` may provide *data* as "
"``b''`` to obtain more of the output."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If all of the input data was decompressed and returned (either because this "
"was less than *max_length* bytes, or because *max_length* was negative), "
"the :attr:`~.needs_input` attribute will be set to ``True``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Attempting to decompress data after the end of stream is reached raises an :"
"exc:`EOFError`.  Any data found after the end of the stream is ignored and "
"saved in the :attr:`~.unused_data` attribute."
msgstr ""

msgid "Added the *max_length* parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ID of the integrity check used by the input stream. This may be :const:"

"Return ``True`` if the given integrity check is supported on this system."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":const:`CHECK_NONE` and :const:`CHECK_CRC32` are always supported. :const:"

msgid "Specifying custom filter chains"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A filter chain specifier is a sequence of dictionaries, where each "

"A filter chain can consist of up to 4 filters, and cannot be empty. The last "
"filter in the chain must be a compression filter, and any other filters must "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Compression filters support the following options (specified as additional "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``preset``: A compression preset to use as a source of default values for "
"options that are not specified explicitly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``dict_size``: Dictionary size in bytes. This should be between 4 KiB and "
"1.5 GiB (inclusive)."
msgstr ""

msgid "``lc``: Number of literal context bits."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``lp``: Number of literal position bits. The sum ``lc + lp`` must be at most "
"4."
msgstr ""

msgid "``pb``: Number of position bits; must be at most 4."
msgstr ""

msgid "``mode``: :const:`MODE_FAST` or :const:`MODE_NORMAL`."

"The delta filter stores the differences between bytes, producing more "
