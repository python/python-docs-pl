msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :mod:`tkinter.ttk` module provides access to the Tk themed widget set, "
"introduced in Tk 8.5. It provides additional benefits including anti-aliased "
"font rendering under X11 and window transparency (requiring a composition "
"window manager on X11)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The basic idea for :mod:`tkinter.ttk` is to separate, to the extent "
"possible, the code implementing a widget's behavior from the code "
"implementing its appearance."

msgid "Using Ttk"
msgstr ""

msgid "To start using Ttk, import its module::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To override the basic Tk widgets, the import should follow the Tk import::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"That code causes several :mod:`tkinter.ttk` widgets (:class:`Button`, :class:"
"`Checkbutton`, :class:`Entry`, :class:`Frame`, :class:`Label`, :class:"
"`LabelFrame`, :class:`Menubutton`, :class:`PanedWindow`, :class:"
"`Radiobutton`, :class:`Scale` and :class:`Scrollbar`) to automatically "
"replace the Tk widgets."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This has the direct benefit of using the new widgets which gives a better "
"look and feel across platforms; however, the replacement widgets are not "
"completely compatible. The main difference is that widget options such as "
"\"fg\", \"bg\" and others related to widget styling are no longer present in "
"Ttk widgets.  Instead, use  the :class:`ttk.Style` class for improved "
"styling effects."
