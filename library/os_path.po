"This module implements some useful functions on pathnames. To read or write "
"files see :func:`open`, and for accessing the filesystem see the :mod:`os` "
"module. The path parameters can be passed as strings, or bytes, or any "
"object implementing the :class:`os.PathLike` protocol."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike a Unix shell, Python does not do any *automatic* path expansions. "
"Functions such as :func:`expanduser` and :func:`expandvars` can be invoked "
"explicitly when an application desires shell-like path expansion.  (See also "
"the :mod:`glob` module.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`pathlib` module offers high-level path objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All of these functions accept either only bytes or only string objects as "
"their parameters.  The result is an object of the same type, if a path or "
"file name is returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since different operating systems have different path name conventions, "
"there are several versions of this module in the standard library.  The :mod:"
"`os.path` module is always the path module suitable for the operating system "
"Python is running on, and therefore usable for local paths.  However, you "
"can also import and use the individual modules if you want to manipulate a "
"path that is *always* in one of the different formats.  They all have the "
"same interface:"

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if pathname *path* is a :dfn:`mount point`: a point in a "

"Join one or more path segments intelligently.  The return value is the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, the drive is not reset when a rooted path segment (e.g., "

"absolute path, all previous segments are ignored and the drive is reset. "
"Note that since there is a current directory for each drive, ``os.path."
