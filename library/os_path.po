msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This module implements some useful functions on pathnames. To read or write "
"files see :func:`open`, and for accessing the filesystem see the :mod:`os` "
"module. The path parameters can be passed as strings, or bytes, or any "
"object implementing the :class:`os.PathLike` protocol."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike a Unix shell, Python does not do any *automatic* path expansions. "
"Functions such as :func:`expanduser` and :func:`expandvars` can be invoked "
"explicitly when an application desires shell-like path expansion.  (See also "
"the :mod:`glob` module.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "The :mod:`pathlib` module offers high-level path objects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All of these functions accept either only bytes or only string objects as "
"their parameters.  The result is an object of the same type, if a path or "
"file name is returned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since different operating systems have different path name conventions, "
"there are several versions of this module in the standard library.  The :mod:"
"`os.path` module is always the path module suitable for the operating system "
"Python is running on, and therefore usable for local paths.  However, you "
"can also import and use the individual modules if you want to manipulate a "
"path that is *always* in one of the different formats.  They all have the "
"same interface:"

":func:`exists`, :func:`lexists`, :func:`isdir`, :func:`isfile`, :func:"
"`islink`, and :func:`ismount` now return ``False`` instead of raising an "
"exception for paths that contain characters or bytes unrepresentable at the "
"OS level."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return a normalized absolutized version of the pathname *path*. On most "

msgid "Accepts a :term:`path-like object`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return the base name of pathname *path*.  This is the second element of the "
"pair returned by passing *path* to the function :func:`split`.  Note that "
"the result of this function is different from the Unix :program:`basename` "
"program; where :program:`basename` for ``'/foo/bar/'`` returns ``'bar'``, "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Unix, an initial ``~`` is replaced by the environment variable :envvar:"

"On Windows, :envvar:`USERPROFILE` will be used if set, otherwise a "

"chopping off a potential drive letter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if *path* is an :func:`existing <exists>` regular file. This "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Return ``True`` if pathname *path* is a :dfn:`mount point`: a point in a "
"file system where a different file system has been mounted.  On POSIX, the "
"function checks whether *path*'s parent, :file:`{path}/..`, is on a "
"different device than *path*, or whether :file:`{path}/..` and *path* point "
"to the same i-node on the same device --- this should detect mount points "
"for all Unix and POSIX variants.  It is not able to reliably detect bind "
"mounts on the same filesystem.  On Windows, a drive letter root and a share "
"UNC are always mount points, and for any other path ``GetVolumePathName`` is "
"called to see if it is different from the input path."
msgstr ""

msgid "Support for detecting non-root mount points on Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Join one or more path segments intelligently.  The return value is the "
"concatenation of *path* and all members of *\\*paths*, with exactly one "
"directory separator following each non-empty part, except the last. That is, "
"the result will only end in a separator if the last part is either empty or "
"ends in a separator. If a segment is an absolute path (which on Windows "
"requires both a drive and a root), then all previous segments are ignored "
"and joining continues from the absolute path segment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, the drive is not reset when a rooted path segment (e.g., "
"``r'\\foo'``) is encountered. If a segment is on a different drive or is an "
"absolute path, all previous segments are ignored and the drive is reset. "
"Note that since there is a current directory for each drive, ``os.path."
"join(\"c:\", \"foo\")`` represents a path relative to the current directory "

"Normalize the case of a pathname.  On Windows, convert all characters in the "
"pathname to lowercase, and also convert forward slashes to backward slashes. "
"On other operating systems, return the path unchanged."

msgid ""
"Normalize a pathname by collapsing redundant separators and up-level "
"references so that ``A//B``, ``A/B/``, ``A/./B`` and ``A/foo/../B`` all "
