msgid ""
"The :mod:`!venv` module supports creating lightweight \"virtual "
"environments\", each with their own independent set of Python packages "
"installed in their :mod:`site` directories. A virtual environment is created "
"on top of an existing Python installation, known as the virtual "
"environment's \"base\" Python, and may optionally be isolated from the "
"packages in the base environment, so only those explicitly installed in the "
"virtual environment are available."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When used from within a virtual environment, common installation tools such "
"as `pip`_ will install Python packages into a virtual environment without "
"needing to be told to do so explicitly."

msgid "Creating virtual environments"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Creation of :ref:`virtual environments <venv-def>` is done by executing the "
"command ``venv``::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Running this command creates the target directory (creating any parent "
"directories that don't exist already) and places a ``pyvenv.cfg`` file in it "
"with a ``home`` key pointing to the Python installation from which the "
"command was run (a common name for the target directory is ``.venv``).  It "
"also creates a ``bin`` (or ``Scripts`` on Windows) subdirectory containing a "
"copy/symlink of the Python binary/binaries (as appropriate for the platform "
"or arguments used at environment creation time). It also creates an "
"(initially empty) ``lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages`` subdirectory (on Windows, "
"this is ``Lib\\site-packages``). If an existing directory is specified, it "
"will be re-used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``pyvenv`` was the recommended tool for creating virtual environments for "
"Python 3.3 and 3.4, and is :ref:`deprecated in Python 3.6 <whatsnew36-venv>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The use of ``venv`` is now recommended for creating virtual environments."
msgstr ""

msgid "On Windows, invoke the ``venv`` command as follows::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, if you configured the ``PATH`` and ``PATHEXT`` variables for "
"your :ref:`Python installation <using-on-windows>`::"
msgstr ""

msgid "The command, if run with ``-h``, will show the available options::"

"options"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In earlier versions, if the target directory already existed, an error was "
"raised, unless the ``--clear`` or ``--upgrade`` option was provided."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While symlinks are supported on Windows, they are not recommended. Of "
"particular note is that double-clicking ``python.exe`` in File Explorer will "
"resolve the symlink eagerly and ignore the virtual environment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Microsoft Windows, it may be required to enable the ``Activate.ps1`` "
"script by setting the execution policy for the user. You can do this by "
"issuing the following PowerShell command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"PS C:\\> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"See `About Execution Policies <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?"

"The created ``pyvenv.cfg`` file also includes the ``include-system-site-"
"packages`` key, set to ``true`` if ``venv`` is run with the ``--system-site-"
"packages`` option, ``false`` otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unless the ``--without-pip`` option is given, :mod:`ensurepip` will be "
"invoked to bootstrap ``pip`` into the virtual environment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multiple paths can be given to ``venv``, in which case an identical virtual "
"environment will be created, according to the given options, at each "
"provided path."
msgstr ""

msgid "How venvs work"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a Python interpreter is running from a virtual environment, :data:`sys."
"prefix` and :data:`sys.exec_prefix` point to the directories of the virtual "
"environment, whereas :data:`sys.base_prefix` and :data:`sys."
"base_exec_prefix` point to those of the base Python used to create the "
"environment. It is sufficient to check ``sys.prefix != sys.base_prefix`` to "
"determine if the current interpreter is running from a virtual environment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A virtual environment may be \"activated\" using a script in its binary "
"directory (``bin`` on POSIX; ``Scripts`` on Windows). This will prepend that "
"directory to your :envvar:`!PATH`, so that running :program:`python` will "
"invoke the environment's Python interpreter and you can run installed "
"scripts without having to use their full path. The invocation of the "
"activation script is platform-specific (:samp:`{<venv>}` must be replaced by "
"the path to the directory containing the virtual environment):"

"PowerShell activation scripts installed under POSIX for PowerShell Core "
"support."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You don't specifically *need* to activate a virtual environment, as you can "
"just specify the full path to that environment's Python interpreter when "
"invoking Python. Furthermore, all scripts installed in the environment "
"should be runnable without activating it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to achieve this, scripts installed into virtual environments have a "
"\"shebang\" line which points to the environment's Python interpreter, i.e. :"
"samp:`#!/{<path-to-venv>}/bin/python`. This means that the script will run "
"with that interpreter regardless of the value of :envvar:`!PATH`. On "
"Windows, \"shebang\" line processing is supported if you have the :ref:"
"`launcher` installed. Thus, double-clicking an installed script in a Windows "
"Explorer window should run it with the correct interpreter without the "
"environment needing to be activated or on the :envvar:`!PATH`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When a virtual environment has been activated, the :envvar:`!VIRTUAL_ENV` "
"environment variable is set to the path of the environment. Since explicitly "
"activating a virtual environment is not required to use it, :envvar:`!"
"VIRTUAL_ENV` cannot be relied upon to determine whether a virtual "
"environment is being used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Because scripts installed in environments should not expect the environment "
"to be activated, their shebang lines contain the absolute paths to their "
"environment's interpreters. Because of this, environments are inherently non-"
"portable, in the general case. You should always have a simple means of "
"recreating an environment (for example, if you have a requirements file "
"``requirements.txt``, you can invoke ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` "
"using the environment's ``pip`` to install all of the packages needed by the "
"environment). If for any reason you need to move the environment to a new "
"location, you should recreate it at the desired location and delete the one "
"at the old location. If you move an environment because you moved a parent "
"directory of it, you should recreate the environment in its new location. "
"Otherwise, software installed into the environment may not work as expected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can deactivate a virtual environment by typing ``deactivate`` in your "
"shell. The exact mechanism is platform-specific and is an internal "
"implementation detail (typically, a script or shell function will be used)."

msgid "API"

msgid ""
"The high-level method described above makes use of a simple API which "
"provides mechanisms for third-party virtual environment creators to "
"customize environment creation according to their needs, the :class:"
"`EnvBuilder` class."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :class:`EnvBuilder` class accepts the following keyword arguments on "
"instantiation:"

msgid ""
"``system_site_packages`` -- a Boolean value indicating that the system "
"Python site-packages should be available to the environment (defaults to "
"``False``)."

"``clear`` -- a Boolean value which, if true, will delete the contents of any "

"``symlinks`` -- a Boolean value indicating whether to attempt to symlink the "
"Python binary rather than copying."

"``upgrade`` -- a Boolean value which, if true, will upgrade an existing "
"environment with the running Python - for use when that Python has been "
"upgraded in-place (defaults to ``False``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``with_pip`` -- a Boolean value which, if true, ensures pip is installed in "
"the virtual environment. This uses :mod:`ensurepip` with the ``--default-"
"pip`` option."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``prompt`` -- a String to be used after virtual environment is activated "
"(defaults to ``None`` which means directory name of the environment would be "
