msgid ""
"The following exception classes are defined in the :mod:`email.errors` "
"module:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the base class for all exceptions that the :mod:`email` package can "
"raise.  It is derived from the standard :exc:`Exception` class and defines "
"no additional methods."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is the base class for exceptions raised by the :class:`~email.parser."
"Parser` class.  It is derived from :exc:`MessageError`.  This class is also "
"used internally by the parser used by :mod:`~email.headerregistry`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raised under some error conditions when parsing the :rfc:`5322` headers of a "
"message, this class is derived from :exc:`MessageParseError`.  The :meth:"
"`~email.message.EmailMessage.set_boundary` method will raise this error if "
"the content type is unknown when the method is called. :class:`~email.header."
"Header` may raise this error for certain base64 decoding errors, and when an "
"attempt is made to create a header that appears to contain an embedded "
"header (that is, there is what is supposed to be a continuation line that "
"has no leading whitespace and looks like a header)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Deprecated and no longer used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Raised when a payload is added to a :class:`~email.message.Message` object "
"using :meth:`add_payload`, but the payload is already a scalar and the "
"message's :mailheader:`Content-Type` main type is not either :mimetype:"
"`multipart` or missing.  :exc:`MultipartConversionError` multiply inherits "
"from :exc:`MessageError` and the built-in :exc:`TypeError`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since :meth:`Message.add_payload` is deprecated, this exception is rarely "
"raised in practice.  However the exception may also be raised if the :meth:"
"`~email.message.Message.attach` method is called on an instance of a class "
"derived from :class:`~email.mime.nonmultipart.MIMENonMultipart` (e.g. :class:"
"`~email.mime.image.MIMEImage`)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here is the list of the defects that the :class:`~email.parser.FeedParser` "
"can find while parsing messages.  Note that the defects are added to the "
"message where the problem was found, so for example, if a message nested "
"inside a :mimetype:`multipart/alternative` had a malformed header, that "
"nested message object would have a defect, but the containing messages would "
"not."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All defect classes are subclassed from :class:`email.errors.MessageDefect`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`NoBoundaryInMultipartDefect` -- A message claimed to be a multipart, "
"but had no :mimetype:`boundary` parameter."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`StartBoundaryNotFoundDefect` -- The start boundary claimed in the :"
"mailheader:`Content-Type` header was never found."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`CloseBoundaryNotFoundDefect` -- A start boundary was found, but no "
"corresponding close boundary was ever found."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`FirstHeaderLineIsContinuationDefect` -- The message had a "
"continuation line as its first header line."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`MisplacedEnvelopeHeaderDefect` - A \"Unix From\" header was found in "
"the middle of a header block."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`MissingHeaderBodySeparatorDefect` - A line was found while parsing "
"headers that had no leading white space but contained no ':'.  Parsing "
"continues assuming that the line represents the first line of the body."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`MalformedHeaderDefect` -- A header was found that was missing a "
"colon, or was otherwise malformed."
msgstr ""

msgid "This defect has not been used for several Python versions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`MultipartInvariantViolationDefect` -- A message claimed to be a :"
"mimetype:`multipart`, but no subparts were found.  Note that when a message "
"has this defect, its :meth:`~email.message.Message.is_multipart` method may "
"return ``False`` even though its content type claims to be :mimetype:"
"`multipart`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`InvalidBase64PaddingDefect` -- When decoding a block of base64 "
"encoded bytes, the padding was not correct.  Enough padding is added to "
"perform the decode, but the resulting decoded bytes may be invalid."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`InvalidBase64CharactersDefect` -- When decoding a block of base64 "
"encoded bytes, characters outside the base64 alphabet were encountered. The "
"characters are ignored, but the resulting decoded bytes may be invalid."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`InvalidBase64LengthDefect` -- When decoding a block of base64 "
"encoded bytes, the number of non-padding base64 characters was invalid (1 "
"more than a multiple of 4).  The encoded block was kept as-is."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
":class:`InvalidDateDefect` -- When decoding an invalid or unparsable date "
"field. The original value is kept as-is."
